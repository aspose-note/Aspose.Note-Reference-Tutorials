## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll delve into utilizing Aspose.Note for Java to roll back to a previous version of a page in OneNote. OneNote is a powerful tool for note-taking, collaboration, and organization, but occasionally, mistakes happen or changes need to be reverted. Aspose.Note offers seamless integration with Java, providing developers with the capability to manage OneNote documents programmatically. Rolling back to a previous page version is a crucial feature for maintaining accuracy and integrity within your OneNote documents.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

### Java Development Environment Setup
1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK): Download and install the latest version of JDK from the Oracle website or your package manager.
2. Setup Java Environment Variables: Configure JAVA_HOME and PATH environment variables to point to your JDK installation directory.
3. Install Aspose.Note for Java: Download the Aspose.Note for Java library from the [website](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy), and follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation.

## Import Packages

To begin, let's import the necessary packages from Aspose.Note for Java into our Java project:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.Page;
import com.aspose.note.PageHistory;
```

Now, let's break down the process of rolling back to a previous page version in OneNote using Aspose.Note for Java into manageable steps:

## Step 1: Load OneNote Document
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document document = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one");
```
First, specify the directory where your OneNote document is located. Then, load the document into an instance of the `Document` class.

## Step 2: Get Page History
```java
Page page = document.getFirstChild();
PageHistory pageHistory = document.getPageHistory(page);
```
Retrieve the page history for the desired page from the loaded document. This will give us access to previous versions of the page.

## Step 3: Remove Current Page
```java
document.removeChild(page);
```
Remove the current version of the page from the document.

## Step 4: Append Previous Page Version
```java
document.appendChildLast(pageHistory.get_Item(pageHistory.size() - 1));
```
Append the desired previous version of the page to the document.

## Step 5: Save Document
```java
document.save(dataDir + "RollBackToPreviousPageVersion_out.one");
```
Save the modified document with the rolled-back page version to the specified directory.
