## Introduction

In the realm of Java development, Aspose.Note stands out as a powerful tool for working with OneNote files. Whether you're aiming to extract information, manipulate content, or generate reports, Aspose.Note provides an extensive set of features to streamline your workflow. In this tutorial, we'll delve into one specific aspect: working with locales in OneNote using Aspose.Note for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

### Java Development Environment

You'll need a Java development environment set up on your system. Ensure you have JDK (Java Development Kit) installed and properly configured.

### Aspose.Note Library

Download and install the Aspose.Note for Java library. You can obtain it from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).

## Import Packages

Before getting started, import the necessary packages into your Java project. These packages provide essential functionalities for working with Aspose.Note.

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.util.Locale;
import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.License;
import com.aspose.note.LocaleOptions;
```

Let's break down the provided example into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Set License

```java
License license = new License();
license.setLicense("licenseFile");
```

Ensure that you set the appropriate license file path to unlock the full capabilities of Aspose.Note.

## Step 2: Set Default Locale

```java
java.util.Locale.setDefault(new java.util.Locale("en", "rs"));
```

Here, we set the default locale to "en" (English) with the country code "rs". This step ensures consistency in language and formatting.

## Step 3: Load Document

```java
String inputFile = "Sample1.one";
Path inputPath = Paths.get(inputFile);

Document oneFile = new Document(inputPath.toString());
```

Load the OneNote document named "Sample1.one" into Aspose.Note for processing.

## Step 4: Save Document

```java
oneFile.save("sample.png");
```

Finally, save the processed document as an image file named "sample.png".
