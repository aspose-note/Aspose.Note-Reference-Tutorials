## Introduction

Welcome to our tutorial on using Aspose.Note for Java to work with OneNote notebooks. Aspose.Note is a powerful Java library that allows developers to create, manipulate, and convert OneNote documents programmatically. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of loading a notebook in OneNote using Aspose.Note for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

### Java Development Kit (JDK)

Ensure that you have JDK installed on your system. You can download the latest version of JDK from the Oracle website.

### Aspose.Note for Java Library

You'll need to download and install Aspose.Note for Java library. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).

### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

Choose an IDE of your preference for Java development. Popular choices include IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and NetBeans.

## Import Packages

To begin, you need to import the necessary packages into your Java project. These packages provide the functionality required to work with OneNote notebooks using Aspose.Note for Java.

```java
import java.io.IOException;

import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.INotebookChildNode;
import com.aspose.note.Notebook;
```

Now, let's dive into the process of loading a notebook in OneNote using Aspose.Note for Java.

## Step 1: Set Data Directory

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to your OneNote notebook directory.

## Step 2: Load Notebook

```java
Notebook notebook = new Notebook(dataDir + "Notizbuch Ã¶ffnen.onetoc2");
```

This code snippet creates a new `Notebook` object and loads the notebook file specified by its path.

## Step 3: Iterate Through Notebook Contents

```java
for (INotebookChildNode notebookChildNode : notebook) {
    System.out.println(notebookChildNode.getDisplayName());

    if (notebookChildNode instanceof Document) {
        // Do something with child document
    } else if (notebookChildNode instanceof Notebook) {
        // Do something with child notebook
    }
}
```

This loop iterates through each child node in the notebook, printing its display name. Depending on whether the child node is a document or a sub-notebook, you can perform specific actions.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've covered the basics of loading a notebook in OneNote using Aspose.Note for Java. By following the steps outlined above, you can integrate Aspose.Note into your Java applications to work with OneNote documents programmatically.
