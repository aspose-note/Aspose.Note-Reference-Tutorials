## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to utilize the Document Visitor in OneNote using Java with Aspose.Note. Document Visitor allows traversing through the elements of a OneNote document and performing operations on them. We'll guide you through the process step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have JDK installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Note for Java: Download and install Aspose.Note for Java from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).

## Import Packages

First, let's import the necessary packages for our Java code:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.DocumentVisitor;
import com.aspose.note.Image;
import com.aspose.note.Outline;
import com.aspose.note.OutlineElement;
import com.aspose.note.OutlineGroup;
import com.aspose.note.Page;
import com.aspose.note.RichText;
import com.aspose.note.Title;
```

## Step 1: Load the Document

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one");
```

Ensure you replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual directory path where your OneNote document is located.

## Step 2: Create Document Visitor

```java
MyOneNoteToTxtWriter myConverter = new MyOneNoteToTxtWriter();
```

Here, we create an instance of `MyOneNoteToTxtWriter`, which is a custom class inheriting from `DocumentVisitor`. This class helps in traversing through the document nodes.

## Step 3: Traverse and Visit Document Nodes

```java
doc.accept(myConverter);
```

By calling `accept()` method on the document and passing our custom visitor, we initiate the visiting process. This method will traverse through each node in the document.

## Step 4: Retrieve Results

```java
System.out.println("Total Nodes: " + myConverter.getNodeCount());
System.out.println(myConverter.getText());
```

After the visiting process is complete, we can retrieve the results. In this example, we print the total number of nodes visited and the accumulated text content.

### Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to use the Document Visitor in OneNote with Java using Aspose.Note. Document Visitor provides a powerful way to traverse through the elements of a document and perform various operations.
