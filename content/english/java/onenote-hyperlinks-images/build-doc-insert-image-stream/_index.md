In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process step by step, ensuring you have a clear understanding of each stage. By the end, you'll be able to effortlessly integrate images into your OneNote documents using Java.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

### Java Development Kit (JDK)

Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download it from the Oracle website.

### Aspose.Note for Java Library

Download and install the Aspose.Note for Java library from the provided [link](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).

### IDE Setup

Set up your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with the necessary configurations to work with Java projects.

## Import Packages

To begin, import the required packages into your Java project. These packages will provide the necessary functionality to work with OneNote documents and images.

```java
import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;
import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.HorizontalAlignment;
import com.aspose.note.Image;
import com.aspose.note.Outline;
import com.aspose.note.OutlineElement;
import com.aspose.note.Page;
import com.aspose.note.SaveFormat;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Document Directory

Define the directory where your document and images are located. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to your directory.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Create Document Object

Initialize an instance of the `Document` class to start working with your OneNote document.

```java
Document doc = new Document();
```

## Step 3: Initialize Page Object

Create a `Page` object to represent the page within the document.

```java
Page page = new Page();
```

## Step 4: Create Outline

Initialize an `Outline` object to structure the content within the page.

```java
Outline outline1 = new Outline();
outline1.setVerticalOffset(600);
outline1.setHorizontalOffset(0);
```

## Step 5: Create Outline Element

Create an `OutlineElement` to hold the image and specify its position.

```java
OutlineElement outlineElem1 = new OutlineElement();
```

## Step 6: Load Image Stream

Load the image stream using the `FileInputStream` for the desired image.

```java
InputStream fs = null;
try {
    fs = new FileInputStream(dataDir + "image.jpg");
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

## Step 7: Insert Image

Insert the image into the document by creating an `Image` object and setting its alignment.

```java
Image image = new Image(null, dataDir + "image1.jpg");
image.setAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Right);
```

## Step 8: Append Image to Outline Element

Append the image to the outline element.

```java
outlineElem1.appendChildLast(image);
```

## Step 9: Append Outline Element to Outline

Add the outline element to the outline.

```java
outline1.appendChildLast(outlineElem1);
```

## Step 10: Append Outline to Page

Add the outline to the page.

```java
page.appendChildLast(outline1);
```

## Step 11: Append Page to Document

Finally, append the page to the document.

```java
doc.appendChildLast(page);
```

## Step 12: Save Document

Save the modified document, specifying the desired format (e.g., PDF).

```java
try {
    doc.save("D://Aspose_JavaProjects//OneNote//out3.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

By following these steps, you can effortlessly build documents and insert images using image streams in OneNote using Aspose.Note for Java.
