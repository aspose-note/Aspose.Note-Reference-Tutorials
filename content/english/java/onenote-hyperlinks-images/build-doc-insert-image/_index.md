## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use Aspose.Note for Java to build OneNote documents and insert images into them. Aspose.Note is a powerful Java API that enables developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically. We'll break down each step in detail to guide you through the process.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Note for Java library: Download and install Aspose.Note for Java library from the [official website](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).
3. IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Use any Java-supported IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for coding.

## Import Packages

Start by importing the necessary packages in your Java code:

```java

import java.io.IOException;

import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.HorizontalAlignment;
import com.aspose.note.Image;
import com.aspose.note.Outline;
import com.aspose.note.OutlineElement;
import com.aspose.note.Page;
import com.aspose.note.SaveFormat;
```

## Step 1: Set Up the Document

First, create a new OneNote document and initialize necessary objects:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document doc = new Document();
Page page = new Page();
```

## Step 2: Initialize Outline

Set up the outline for the document and specify offset properties:

```java
Outline outline = new Outline();
outline.setVerticalOffset(0);
outline.setHorizontalOffset(0);
```

## Step 3: Add Image

Load an image and specify its alignment:

```java
Image image = new Image(null, dataDir + "Input.jpg");
image.setAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Right);
```

## Step 4: Add Image to Outline Element

Attach the image to an outline element:

```java
OutlineElement outlineElem = new OutlineElement();
outlineElem.appendChildLast(image);
```

## Step 5: Add Outline and Page Nodes

Add the outline and page nodes to the document:

```java
outline.appendChildLast(outlineElem);
page.appendChildLast(outline);
doc.appendChildLast(page);
```

## Step 6: Save Document

Finally, save the OneNote document:

```java
try {
    doc.save(dataDir + "NewOneNotedocument_out", SaveFormat.Pdf);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to build OneNote documents and insert images into them using Aspose.Note for Java. By following these steps, you can efficiently manage and manipulate OneNote files in your Java applications.
