## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to add hyperlinks to images in OneNote using Java. Hyperlinking images can greatly enhance the interactivity and usefulness of your documents, allowing users to easily access related content or external resources with a simple click.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Basic understanding of Java programming language.
3. Aspose.Note for Java library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).
4. An integrated development environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

## Import Packages

Before we dive into the implementation, let's import the necessary packages:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import com.aspose.note.*;
```

## Step 1: Set up Document Directory

First, define the directory where your document and images are located:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Create Document Object

Now, let's create a new document object:

```java
Document document = new Document();
```

## Step 3: Create Page Object

Next, we'll create a page object to add our image and hyperlink:

```java
Page page = new Page();
```

## Step 4: Add Image with Hyperlink

Add the image to the page and set its hyperlink URL:

```java
Image image = new Image(null, dataDir + "image1.jpg");
image.setHyperlinkUrl("http://www.aspose.com");
page.appendChildLast(image);
```

## Step 5: Save the Document

Finally, save the modified document:

```java
document.appendChildLast(page);
document.save(dataDir + "HyperlinkToImage_out.one");
```
