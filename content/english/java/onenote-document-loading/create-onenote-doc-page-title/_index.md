Now, let's break down the example code provided into multiple steps to understand the process of creating a OneNote document with a page title in Java using Aspose.Note.

## Step 1: Set Up Document Directory

Define the directory where you want to save the OneNote document.

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Create Document Object

Initialize an object of the Document class to start working with the OneNote document.

```java
// Create an object of the Document class
Document doc = new Document();
```

## Step 3: Initialize Page Object

Create a Page object to represent the page within the OneNote document.

```java
// Initialize Page class object
Page page = new Page();
```

## Step 4: Set Default Text Style

Define the default style for all text in the document, including font color, name, and size.

```java
// Default style for all text in the document.
ParagraphStyle textStyle = new ParagraphStyle()
                            .setFontColor(Color.BLACK)
                            .setFontName("Arial")
                            .setFontSize(10);
```

## Step 5: Set Page Title Properties

Configure the properties of the page title, such as text, date, and time.

```java
// Set page title properties
Title title = new Title();

RichText titleText = new RichText().append("Title text.");
titleText.setParagraphStyle(textStyle);
title.setTitleText(titleText);

Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
cal.set(2018, 04, 03);
RichText titleDate = new RichText().append(cal.getTime().toString());
titleDate.setParagraphStyle(textStyle);
title.setTitleDate(titleDate);

RichText titleTime = new RichText().append("12:34");
titleTime.setParagraphStyle(textStyle);
title.setTitleText(titleTime);
```

## Step 6: Set Page Title

Assign the title properties to the page.

```java
page.setTitle(title);
```

## Step 7: Append Page to Document

Add the page node to the document.

```java
doc.appendChildLast(page);
```

## Step 8: Save OneNote Document

Specify the output directory and save the created OneNote document.

```java
dataDir = dataDir + "load//CreateDocWithPageTitle_out.one";

// Save OneNote document
doc.save(dataDir);
```
