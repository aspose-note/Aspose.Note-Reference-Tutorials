## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of converting a specific page to an image in OneNote using Java with Aspose.Note. By following these steps, you'll be able to seamlessly integrate this functionality into your Java applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) if you haven't already.

2. Aspose.Note for Java: You'll need to have Aspose.Note for Java library. You can obtain it from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).

## Import Packages

First, let's import the necessary packages:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.ImageSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.note.SaveFormat;
<<<<<<< Updated upstream


public class ConvertSpecificPageToImage {
	public static void main(String... args) throws IOException {
		// ExStart:ConvertSpecificPageToImage
		String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

		// Load the document into Aspose.Note
		Document oneFile = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one");

		// Initialize PdfSaveOptions object
		ImageSaveOptions options = new ImageSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Jpeg);

		// Specify second page for conversion
		options.setPageIndex(1);

		// Save the document
		oneFile.save(dataDir + "ConvertSpecificPageToImage_out.jpg", options);

		System.out.println("File saved: " + dataDir + "ConvertSpecificPageToImage_out.jpg");
		// ExEnd:ConvertSpecificPageToImage
	}
}

## Step 1: Load the Document

Begin by loading the OneNote document using Aspose.Note:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Load the document into Aspose.Note
Document oneFile = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one");
```

## Step 2: Initialize Options

Initialize the options for saving the image:

```java
// Initialize PdfSaveOptions object
ImageSaveOptions options = new ImageSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Jpeg);
```

## Step 3: Specify Page Index

Specify the index of the page you want to convert. Here, we're selecting the second page:

```java
// Specify second page for conversion
options.setPageIndex(1);
```

## Step 4: Save the Document

Save the document as an image:

```java
// Save the document
oneFile.save(dataDir + "ConvertSpecificPageToImage_out.jpg", options);
```

## Step 5: Print Confirmation

Print a confirmation message after the conversion is complete:

```java
// Print confirmation message
System.out.println("File saved: " + dataDir + "ConvertSpecificPageToImage_out.jpg");
```
