## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to optimize the export performance of OneNote documents using Java with Aspose.Note. We'll guide you through the process step by step, ensuring that you can efficiently export your OneNote documents to various formats while maintaining performance.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your system. You can download and install JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
   
2. Aspose.Note for Java: Download and install Aspose.Note for Java from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).

## Import Packages

Firstly, you need to import the necessary packages into your Java project to work with Aspose.Note. Here's how you can do it:

```java
import java.awt.Color;
import java.io.IOException;

import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.Page;
import com.aspose.note.RichText;
import com.aspose.note.ParagraphStyle;
import com.aspose.note.Title;
```

Let's break down the provided example into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Set up Document Directory

Ensure you have a directory set up to store your documents. This directory will be used to save the exported OneNote documents in various formats.

## Step 2: Initialize Document

Initialize a new Document object using the following code:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document doc = new Document();
```

This creates a new instance of the Document class.

## Step 3: Disable Layout Changes Detection

Disable the detection of layout changes to improve export performance:

```java
doc.setAutomaticLayoutChangesDetectionEnabled(false);
```

This step prevents unnecessary layout changes detection during the export process.

## Step 4: Create a New Page

Create a new Page object:

```java
Page page = new Page();
```

This step initializes a new page within the document.

## Step 5: Define Text Style

Define the style for all text in the document:

```java
ParagraphStyle textStyle = new ParagraphStyle()
                                .setFontColor(Color.BLACK)
                                .setFontName("Arial")
                                .setFontSize(10);
```

This sets the font color, name, and size for the text.

## Step 6: Create Title Text, Date, and Time

Create title text, date, and time objects:

```java
RichText titleText = new RichText().append("Title text.");
RichText titleDate = new RichText().append("2011,11,11");
RichText titleTime = new RichText().append("12:34");
```

These steps initialize the title text, date, and time for the page.

## Step 7: Add Title to Page

Add the title, date, and time to the page:

```java
Title title = new Title();
title.setTitleText(titleText);
title.setTitleDate(titleDate);
title.setTitleTime(titleTime);
page.setTitle(title);
```

This adds the title, date, and time to the page.

## Step 8: Add Page to Document

Add the page to the document:

```java
doc.appendChildLast(page);
```

This step appends the page to the document.

## Step 9: Save Document in Various Formats

Save the OneNote document in PDF, TIFF, JPG, and BMP formats:

```java
doc.save(dataDir + "OptimizeExportPerformance_out.pdf");
doc.save(dataDir + "OptimizeExportPerformance_out.tiff");
doc.save(dataDir + "OptimizeExportPerformance_out.jpg");
doc.save(dataDir + "OptimizeExportPerformance_out.bmp");
```

These steps save the document in different image formats.

## Step 10: Set Text Font Size and Trigger Layout Detection

Manually set the text font size and trigger layout detection:

```java
textStyle.setFontSize(24);
doc.detectLayoutChanges();
```

These steps adjust the font size and manually trigger layout detection.
