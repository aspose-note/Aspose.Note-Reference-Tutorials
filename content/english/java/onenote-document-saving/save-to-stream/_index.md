## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into using Aspose.Note for Java, a powerful library for working with Microsoft OneNote documents programmatically. Specifically, we will focus on the process of saving OneNote documents to a stream. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you'll be able to efficiently manipulate OneNote files within your Java applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we proceed, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your system. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
   
2. Aspose.Note for Java JAR file: Download the Aspose.Note for Java library from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/). Follow the installation instructions to set up the library in your project.

3. OneNote Document: Prepare a sample OneNote document that you will use for testing purposes. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to access and modify this document.

## Import Packages

First, you need to import the required packages into your Java project. These packages provide the necessary classes and methods to work with OneNote documents using Aspose.Note for Java.

```java
import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.SaveFormat;
```

Let's break down the example provided into step-by-step guide format:

## Step 1: Load the OneNote Document

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Load the document into Aspose.Note
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one");
```

Here, we load the OneNote document named "Sample1.one" into an instance of the `Document` class using Aspose.Note for Java.

## Step 2: Create a Stream Object

```java
// Create a stream object
ByteArrayOutputStream stream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
```

We create a `ByteArrayOutputStream` object to hold the data of the OneNote document in memory.

## Step 3: Save the Document to Stream as PDF

```java
// Save the document to stream as a PDF
doc.save(stream, SaveFormat.Pdf);
```

This step involves saving the loaded OneNote document to the stream in PDF format using the `save` method of the `Document` class.

## Step 4: Display Stream Size

```java
System.out.println("Stream Size: " + stream.size() + " bytes");
```

Finally, we print the size of the stream, indicating the amount of data stored in memory.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to save a OneNote document to a stream using Aspose.Note for Java. By following the provided steps, you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your Java applications, allowing for efficient manipulation of OneNote files programmatically.
