## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to save a document as a grayscale image in OneNote using Aspose.Note for Java. Grayscale images are monochromatic images where the color information is represented only by shades of gray. Aspose.Note is a powerful Java API that allows manipulation of Microsoft OneNote documents programmatically.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Note for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).
3. Basic understanding of Java programming.

## Import Packages

To get started, import the necessary packages:

```java
import com.aspose.note.ColorMode;
import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.ImageSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.note.SaveFormat;
import java.io.IOException;
```

## Step 1: Load the Document

First, load the document into Aspose.Note. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to your document directory and `"Aspose.one"` with the name of your OneNote document.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document oneFile = new Document(dataDir + "Aspose.one");
```

## Step 2: Set Output Path and Options

Define the output path for the grayscale image and specify the saving options. We'll set the color mode to grayscale.

```java
dataDir = dataDir + "SaveAsGrayscaleImage_out.png";
ImageSaveOptions options = new ImageSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Png);
options.setColorMode(ColorMode.GrayScale);
```

## Step 3: Save the Document

Finally, save the document as a grayscale image using the specified options.

```java
oneFile.save(dataDir, options);
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to save a document as a grayscale image in OneNote using Aspose.Note for Java. This can be incredibly useful for various applications where grayscale images are required.
