## Introduction

Aspose.Note for Java is a powerful API that allows developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically. In this tutorial, we will explore how to save a document as a binary image using a fixed threshold. Follow the steps below to achieve this.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Note for Java library downloaded. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).

```

## Step 2: Set Binarization Options

Define the binarization options for saving the document as a binary image.

```java
dataDir = dataDir + "SaveToBinaryImageUsingFixedThreshold_out.png";
ImageBinarizationOptions binarizationOptions = new ImageBinarizationOptions();
binarizationOptions.setBinarizationMethod(BinarizationMethod.FixedThreshold);
binarizationOptions.setBinarizationThreshold(123);
```

## Step 3: Set Image Save Options

Set the image save options including color mode and binarization options.

```java
ImageSaveOptions options = new ImageSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Png);
options.setColorMode(ColorMode.BlackAndWhite);
options.setBinarizationOptions(binarizationOptions);
```

## Step 4: Save the Document

Save the document as a binary image with the specified options.

```java
oneFile.save(dataDir, options);
```
