## Introduction

OneNote is a popular tool for note-taking and organizing information, and with the help of Aspose.Note for Java, you can enhance its capabilities by programmatically attaching files and setting icons to improve the visual representation of your notes. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

1. Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have Java installed on your system, along with a compatible Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
   
2. Aspose.Note for Java Library: You'll need to download and install the Aspose.Note for Java library. You can download it from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).

## Import Packages

First, you need to import the necessary packages from the Aspose.Note library into your Java project:

```java
import com.aspose.note.*;

import com.aspose.note.system.drawing.ImageFormat;

import java.io.FileInputStream;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.io.IOException;
```

## Step 1: Create a Document Object

Begin by creating a Document object, which represents the OneNote document you'll be working with:

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Create an object of the Document class
Document doc = new Document();
```

## Step 2: Initialize Page and Outline Objects

Next, initialize Page and Outline objects:

```java
// Initialize Page class object
Page page = new Page();

// Initialize Outline class object
Outline outline = new Outline();
```

## Step 3: Initialize OutlineElement Object

Now, initialize an OutlineElement object:

```java
// Initialize OutlineElement class object
OutlineElement outlineElem = new OutlineElement();
```

## Step 4: Create AttachedFile Object with Icon

Create an AttachedFile object and specify the path to the file you want to attach, along with its icon:

```java
// Initialize AttachedFile class object and also pass its icon path
AttachedFile attachedFile = null;
try {
    attachedFile = new AttachedFile(dataDir + "attachment.txt", new FileInputStream(dataDir  + "icon.jpg"), ImageFormat.getJpeg());
} catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

## Step 5: Append AttachedFile to OutlineElement

Append the AttachedFile to the OutlineElement:

```java
// Add attached file
outlineElem.appendChildLast(attachedFile);
```

## Step 6: Append OutlineElement to Outline

Next, append the OutlineElement to the Outline:

```java
// Add outline element node
outline.appendChildLast(outlineElem);
```

## Step 7: Append Outline to Page

Append the Outline to the Page:

```java
// Add outline node
page.appendChildLast(outline);
```

## Step 8: Append Page to Document

Finally, append the Page to the Document:

```java
// Add page node
doc.appendChildLast(page);
```

## Step 9: Save the Document

Save the modified Document to a file:

```java
dataDir = dataDir + "AttachFileAndSetIcon_out.one";
doc.save(dataDir);
```

Now, you've successfully attached a file and set an icon in OneNote using Java with Aspose.Note.
