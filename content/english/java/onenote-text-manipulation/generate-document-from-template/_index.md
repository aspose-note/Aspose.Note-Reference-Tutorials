## Introduction
Are you looking to streamline document generation in your Java application? Aspose.Note for Java provides a powerful solution. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through generating documents from templates using Aspose.Note for Java, making the entire process easy and efficient.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- A basic understanding of Java programming.
- Aspose.Note for Java library. If not installed, download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).
- A template document (e.g., "JobOffer.one") for document generation.
## Import Packages
Begin by importing the necessary packages into your Java project. This step ensures that you have access to all the functionalities provided by Aspose.Note for Java.
```java
import com.aspose.note.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import com.aspose.note.RichText
```
## Step 1: Define Template Data
Here, we define a hashmap (`D`) with key-value pairs representing the template data. These values will replace the placeholders in the template document.
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
HashMap<String, String> D = new HashMap<>();
D.put("Company", "Atlas Shrugged Ltd");
D.put("CandidateName", "John Galt");
D.put("JobTitle", "Chief Entrepreneur Officer");
D.put("Department", "Sales");
D.put("Salary", "123456 USD");
D.put("Vacation", "30");
D.put("StartDate", "29 Feb 2024");
D.put("YourName", "Ayn Rand");
```
Ensure you replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual directory path.
## Step 2: Load Template Document
Now, we load the template document ("JobOffer.one") using the `Document` class from Aspose.Note for Java.
```java
// Load the template document into Aspose.Note.
Document d = new Document(Paths.get(dataDir, "JobOffer.one").toString());
```
## Step 3: Replace Template Words
In this step, we iterate through the document's child nodes to replace template words with the corresponding values from the hashmap.
```java
// Let's replace all template words
for (RichText e : d.getChildNodes(RichText.class)) {
    for (Map.Entry<String, String> replace : D.entrySet()) {
        e.replace(String.format("${%s}", replace.getKey()), replace.getValue());
    }
}
```
This ensures that each placeholder in the document is replaced with the relevant data.
## Step 4: Save the Generated Document
After replacing the template words, we save the modified document with a new name (e.g., "JobOffer_out.one") to the specified directory.
```java
// Save the modified document with a new name (e.g., "JobOffer_out.one") to your specified directory.
d.save(Paths.get(dataDir, "JobOffer_out.one").toString());
```
## Step 5: Confirm Successful Generation
Finally, we display a confirmation message to indicate that the document has been generated successfully.
```java
// Display a confirmation message.
System.out.println("\nThe document is generated successfully.");
```
