2. Aspose.Note for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.Note for Java library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).
3. Document to Extract Text: Have a sample OneNote document (e.g., "Sample1.one") ready in your designated document directory.
## Import Packages
In your Java project, include the necessary packages to utilize Aspose.Note functionality. Here's a sample code snippet for importing packages:
```java

## Step 3: Retrieve Text Nodes
Retrieve text nodes from the loaded document:
```java
List<RichText> textNodes = (List<RichText>) oneFile.getChildNodes(RichText.class);
```
## Step 4: Extract Text
Create a StringBuilder to store the extracted text:
```java
StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder();
for (RichText richText : textNodes) {
    text = text.append(richText.getText().toString());
}
```
## Step 5: Print Text
Print the extracted text on the output screen:
```java
