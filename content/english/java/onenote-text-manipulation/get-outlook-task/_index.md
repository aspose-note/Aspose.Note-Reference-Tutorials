## Introduction
Welcome to the world of Aspose.Note for Java â€“ a powerful tool that empowers Java developers to seamlessly work with Microsoft OneNote files. In this step-by-step guide, we'll walk you through the process of extracting Outlook Task information from a OneNote document using Aspose.Note for Java.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
- Aspose.Note for Java: Download and install the Aspose.Note library from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).
## Import Packages
Begin by importing the necessary packages into your Java project. Add the following lines at the beginning of your Java file:
```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.List;
import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.ITag;
import com.aspose.note.NoteTask;
import com.aspose.note.RichText;
```
## Step 1: Set up Your Project
Create a new Java project and include the Aspose.Note library in your project's dependencies. Make sure your project structure is organized, and you have a dedicated directory for your documents.
## Step 2: Load the OneNote Document
Use the following code to load your OneNote document into Aspose.Note:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one");
```
Ensure to replace "Your Document Directory" with the path to your OneNote document.
## Step 3: Retrieve RichText Nodes
Extract all RichText nodes from the document using the following code:
```java
List<RichText> nodes = (List<RichText>) doc.getChildNodes(RichText.class);
```
## Step 4: Iterate Through Each Node
Loop through each RichText node and identify if it contains a NoteTask tag:
```java
for (RichText richText : nodes) {
    for (ITag tag : richText.getTags()) {
        if (tag.getClass() == NoteTask.class) {
            // Your code to handle NoteTask
        }
    }
}
```
## Step 5: Retrieve Task Properties
Retrieve and print various properties of the NoteTask, such as Completed Time, Creation Time, Due Date, Status, and Icon:
```java
NoteTask noteTask = (NoteTask) tag;
System.out.println("Completed Time: " + noteTask.getCompletedTime());
System.out.println("Create Time: " + noteTask.getCreationTime());
System.out.println("Due Date: " + noteTask.getDueDate());
System.out.println("Status: " + noteTask.getStatus());
System.out.println("Icon: " + noteTask.getIcon());
```
Repeat this process for all NoteTask nodes in the document.
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to use Aspose.Note for Java to extract Outlook Task information from a OneNote document. This powerful library opens up a world of possibilities for Java developers working with Microsoft OneNote files.
