## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Note for .NET: Download and install Aspose.Note for .NET from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).

## Import Namespaces

Before diving into the code, let's import the necessary namespaces:

Now, let's break down the provided example into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Load the Document

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load the document into Aspose.Note.
Document oneFile = new Document(dataDir + "Aspose.one");
```

In this step, we initialize a `Document` object and load the OneNote file into it.

## Step 2: Save as PDF with Default Settings

```csharp
// Save the document as PDF
dataDir = dataDir + "SaveWithDefaultSettings_out.pdf";
oneFile.Save(dataDir, SaveFormat.Pdf);
```

Here, we save the loaded document as a PDF file with default settings.

## Step 3: Display Success Message

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nOneNote document saved successfully with default settings.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
