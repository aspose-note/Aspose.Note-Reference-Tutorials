## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll delve into performing consequent export operations using Aspose.Note for .NET. Aspose.Note is a powerful library that enables developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically. Exporting documents to different formats is a common requirement, and Aspose.Note simplifies this task efficiently. Let's explore how to save a document in various formats step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this tutorial, ensure you have the following:

1. Basic understanding of C# programming language.
2. Visual Studio installed on your system.
3. Aspose.Note for .NET library integrated into your project.

## Import Namespaces

To begin with, make sure to import the necessary namespaces in your C# code:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Note;
using System;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Globalization;
```

## Step 1: Initialize the Document

Firstly, initialize a new `Document` object with automatic layout changes detection disabled:

```csharp
Document doc = new Document() { AutomaticLayoutChangesDetectionEnabled = false };
```

## Step 2: Initialize a New Page

Create a new `Page` object and specify its properties:

```csharp
Aspose.Note.Page page = new Aspose.Note.Page(doc);
```

## Step 3: Set Page Title

Define the title for the page along with date and time information:

```csharp
ParagraphStyle textStyle = new ParagraphStyle { FontColor = Color.Black, FontName = "Arial", FontSize = 10 };
page.Title = new Title(doc)
{
    TitleText = new RichText(doc) { Text = "Title text.", ParagraphStyle = textStyle },
    TitleDate = new RichText(doc) { Text = new DateTime(2011, 11, 11).ToString("D", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture), ParagraphStyle = textStyle },
    TitleTime = new RichText(doc) { Text = "12:34", ParagraphStyle = textStyle }
};
```

## Step 4: Append Page Node

Add the page node to the document:

```csharp
doc.AppendChildLast(page);
```

## Step 5: Save Document in Different Formats

Now, save the OneNote document in various formats:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
doc.Save(dataDir + "ConsequentExportOperations_out.html");            
doc.Save(dataDir + "ConsequentExportOperations_out.pdf");            
doc.Save(dataDir + "ConsequentExportOperations_out.jpg");            
textStyle.FontSize = 11;           
doc.DetectLayoutChanges();            
doc.Save(dataDir + "ConsequentExportOperations_out.bmp");
```
