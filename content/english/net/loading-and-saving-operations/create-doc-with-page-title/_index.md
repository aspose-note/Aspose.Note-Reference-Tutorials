Now, let's break down the process of creating a document with a page title into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Create a Document Object

```csharp
// Create an object of the Document class
Document doc = new Aspose.Note.Document();
```

## Step 2: Initialize Page Class Object

```csharp
// Initialize Page class object
Aspose.Note.Page page = new Aspose.Note.Page(doc);
```

## Step 3: Set Default Style for Text

```csharp
// Default style for all text in the document.
ParagraphStyle textStyle = new ParagraphStyle { FontColor = Color.Black, FontName = "Arial", FontSize = 10 };
```

## Step 4: Set Page Title Properties

```csharp
// Set page title properties
page.Title = new Title(doc)
{
    TitleText = new RichText(doc) { Text = "Title text.", ParagraphStyle = textStyle },
    TitleDate = new RichText(doc) { Text = new DateTime(2011, 11, 11).ToString("D", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture), ParagraphStyle = textStyle },
    TitleTime = new RichText(doc) { Text = "12:34", ParagraphStyle = textStyle }
};
```

## Step 5: Append Page Node in the Document

```csharp
// Append Page node in the document
doc.AppendChildLast(page);
```

## Step 6: Save OneNote Document

```csharp
// Save OneNote document
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
dataDir = dataDir + "CreateDocWithPageTitle_out.one";
doc.Save(dataDir);
```
