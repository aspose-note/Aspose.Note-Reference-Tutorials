## Introduction

Aspose.Note for .NET is a powerful API that allows developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically in their .NET applications. Whether you need to load, manipulate, or convert OneNote documents, Aspose.Note for .NET provides comprehensive functionality to streamline your workflow.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio, a comprehensive integrated development environment (IDE) for .NET development.
2. Aspose.Note for .NET: Download and install Aspose.Note for .NET from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).
3. Basic C# Knowledge: Familiarity with C# programming language fundamentals is necessary to understand and implement the examples provided in this tutorial.

## Import Namespaces

Before you start working with Aspose.Note for .NET, make sure to import the required namespaces into your C# project:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
```

Let's break down each example into multiple steps:

## Load OneNote Document in Aspose.Note

### Step 1: Simple Load Notebook:
   - Begin by creating a new instance of the `Notebook` class, passing the path to the OneNote document.
   - Iterate through the notebook's child nodes using a foreach loop.
   - Display the display name of each child node.
   - Perform specific actions based on whether the child node is a document or another notebook.

```csharp
public static void SimpleLoadNotebook()
{
    // The path to the documents directory.
    string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
    string fileName = "Open Notebook.onetoc2";
    try
    {
        var notebook = new Notebook(Path.Combine(dataDir, fileName));
        foreach (var notebookChildNode in notebook)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(notebookChildNode.DisplayName);
            if (notebookChildNode is Document)
            {
                // Do something with child document
            }
            else if (notebookChildNode is Notebook)
            {
                // Do something with child notebook
            }
        }
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Check If Document is Encrypted and Load:
   - Check if the OneNote document is encrypted by calling the `Document.IsEncrypted` method, passing the file name.
   - If not encrypted, proceed with document processing.
   - If encrypted, prompt the user to provide a password for decryption.

```csharp
public static void Document_CheckIfEncryptedAndLoad()
{
    // The path to the documents directory.
    string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
    string fileName = Path.Combine(dataDir, "Aspose.one");

    Document document;
    if (!Document.IsEncrypted(fileName, out document))
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The document is loaded and ready to be processed.");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The document is encrypted. Provide a password.");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Check If Document is Encrypted by Password and Load:
   - Similar to the previous step, check if the document is encrypted by a specific password.
   - If encrypted and the correct password is provided, proceed with document processing.
   - If encrypted but an incorrect password is provided, prompt the user about the invalid password.

```csharp
public static void Document_CheckIfEncryptedByPasswordAndLoad()
{
    // The path to the documents directory.
    string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
    string fileName = Path.Combine(dataDir, "Aspose.one");

    Document document;
    if (Document.IsEncrypted(fileName, "VerySecretPassword", out document))
    {
        if (document != null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The document is decrypted. It is loaded and ready to be processed.");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine("The document is encrypted. Invalid password was provided.");
        }
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The document is NOT encrypted. It is loaded and ready to be processed.");
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Handle Unsupported OneNote 2007 Format:
   - Attempt to load a OneNote document in the 2007 format.
   - If the format is not supported, catch the `UnsupportedFileFormatException` and handle it appropriately, informing the user about the unsupported format.

```csharp
public static void Document_OneNote2007_Is_NotSupported()
{
    // The path to the documents directory.
    string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
    string fileName = Path.Combine(dataDir, "OneNote2007.one");

    try
    {
        new Document(fileName);
    }
    catch (UnsupportedFileFormatException e)
    {
        if (e.FileFormat == FileFormat.OneNote2007)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("It looks like the provided file is in OneNote 2007 format that is not supported.");
        }
        else
            throw;
    }
}
```
