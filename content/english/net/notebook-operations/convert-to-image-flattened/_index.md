string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load a OneNote Notebook
var notebook = new Notebook(dataDir + "Notizbuch Ã¶ffnen.onetoc2");
```

## Step 2: Set Save Options

Define the save options for the notebook, including the image format and resolution.

```csharp
var notebookSaveOptions = new NotebookImageSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Png);
var documentSaveOptions = notebookSaveOptions.DocumentSaveOptions;

documentSaveOptions.Resolution = 400;
notebookSaveOptions.Flatten = true;
```

## Step 3: Save the Notebook as Image

Now, save the notebook as a flattened image using the defined save options.

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "ConvertToImageAsFlattenedNotebook_out.png";

// Save the Notebook
notebook.Save(dataDir, notebookSaveOptions);
