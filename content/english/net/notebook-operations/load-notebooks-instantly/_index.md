```

## Step 2: Load the Notebook

Next, specify the path to the notebook file and initialize the notebook object using the specified load options.

```csharp
String inputFile = "Notizbuch Ã¶ffnen.onetoc2";
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Notebook notebook = new Notebook(dataDir + inputFile, loadOptions);
```

## Step 3: Access Child Documents

Once the notebook is loaded with instant loading enabled, you can access all child documents instantly.

```csharp
foreach (INotebookChildNode notebookChildNode in notebook.OfType<Document>()) 
{
   // Perform operations on each child document
}
```
