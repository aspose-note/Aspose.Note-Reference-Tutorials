## Introduction

Aspose.Note for .NET is a powerful API that enables developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically. In this tutorial, we will learn how to load password-protected documents using Aspose.Note for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of C# programming language.
- Installed Aspose.Note for .NET library. If not installed, you can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).

using System.Drawing;
using System.Globalization;
```

## Step 1: Load the Password-Protected Document

First, we need to load the password-protected document using Aspose.Note API. We'll specify the document path and provide the document password.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var notebook = new Notebook(dataDir + "test.onetoc2", new NotebookLoadOptions() { DeferredLoading = true });
```

## Step 2: Load Child Documents with Passwords

Next, we'll load child documents that are password-protected. We'll use the `LoadChildDocument` method and provide the path to the child document along with the corresponding password.

```csharp
notebook.LoadChildDocument(dataDir + "Aspose.one");  
notebook.LoadChildDocument(dataDir + "Locked Pass1.one", new LoadOptions() { DocumentPassword = "pass" });
notebook.LoadChildDocument(dataDir + "Locked Pass2.one", new LoadOptions() { DocumentPassword = "pass2" });
```
