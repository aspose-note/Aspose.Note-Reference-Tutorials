## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Now, let's break down the process of converting notebooks to PDF with options into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Load the Notebook

First, we need to load the OneNote notebook that we want to convert into a PDF file.

```csharp

string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load a OneNote Notebook
var notebook = new Notebook(dataDir + "Notizbuch ï¿½ffnen.onetoc2");
```

## Step 2: Specify PDF Save Options

Next, we'll specify the options for saving the notebook as a PDF file. We can customize various settings such as page splitting algorithm, margins, and page size.

```csharp
var notebookSaveOptions = new NotebookPdfSaveOptions();
var documentSaveOptions = notebookSaveOptions.DocumentSaveOptions;

documentSaveOptions.PageSplittingAlgorithm = new KeepSolidObjectsAlgorithm();
```

## Step 3: Save the Notebook as PDF

Now, we'll save the notebook as a PDF file using the specified options.

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "ConvertToPDF_out.pdf";

// Save the Notebook
notebook.Save(dataDir, notebookSaveOptions);
```

## Step 4: Verify Conversion

Finally, let's verify that the conversion was successful and print the location where the PDF file is saved.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nNoteBook document converted to pdf successfully with save options.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
```
