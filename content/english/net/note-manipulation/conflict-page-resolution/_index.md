## Introduction

Resolving conflicts in Aspose.Note documents is a crucial task, especially when dealing with collaborative projects or multiple contributors. These conflicts may arise due to simultaneous edits, differing versions, or other discrepancies within the document. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of identifying and resolving conflicts within Aspose.Note documents using .NET. By following these steps, you'll be equipped to efficiently manage conflicts and ensure document integrity.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into conflict resolution with Aspose.Note for .NET, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Basic Understanding of .NET: Familiarity with the .NET framework and C# programming language is essential.
2. Installation of Aspose.Note for .NET: Download and install Aspose.Note for .NET from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).
3. IDE: Have an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio installed on your system.

## Import Namespaces

To begin resolving conflicts in Aspose.Note documents, import the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

## Step 1: Load the Aspose.Note Document

Firstly, load the Aspose.Note document into your application. Set the directory path where your document is located.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Aspose.one", new LoadOptions { LoadHistory = true });
```

## Step 2: Retrieve Page History

Next, retrieve the history of pages within the document. Iterate through each page to analyze its revision history.

```csharp
var history = doc.GetPageHistory(doc.FirstChild);
```

## Step 3: Analyze Conflict Pages

Iterate through the history of pages and check for conflict pages. Determine whether each page is a conflict page and take appropriate action.

```csharp
for (int i = 0; i < history.Count; i++)
{
    var historyPage = history[i];
    Console.Write("    {0}. Author: {1}, {2:dd.MM.yyyy hh.mm.ss}",
                    i,
                    historyPage.PageContentRevisionSummary.AuthorMostRecent,
                    historyPage.PageContentRevisionSummary.LastModifiedTime);
    Console.WriteLine(historyPage.IsConflictPage ? ", IsConflict: true" : string.Empty);

    // Mark non-conflict pages to be saved as usual in the history
    if (historyPage.IsConflictPage)
        historyPage.IsConflictPage = false;
}
```

## Step 4: Save Resolved Document

Save the document after resolving conflicts to ensure changes are applied.

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "ConflictPageManipulation_out.one", SaveFormat.One);
```
