## Introduction

Aspose.Note for .NET allows developers to manipulate OneNote documents programmatically. One common task is setting the background color of pages within these documents. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

1. Basic knowledge of C# programming language.
2. Visual Studio installed on your system.
3. Aspose.Note for .NET library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).

Document document = new Document(Path.Combine(dataDir, "Aspose.one"));
```

## Step 2: Iterate Through Pages

```csharp
foreach (var page in document)
{
    // Step 3 goes here
}
```

## Step 3: Set Background Color

```csharp
page.BackgroundColor = Color.BlueViolet;
```

You can choose any color by replacing `Color.BlueViolet` with the desired color.
