## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of extracting text from table cells using Aspose.Note for .NET. Tables are commonly used in documents to organize information, and being able to extract text from specific cells can be incredibly useful for various applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we proceed, ensure you have the following:

- Basic knowledge of C# programming language.
- Installed Visual Studio IDE.
- Aspose.Note for .NET library installed.
- Sample document containing tables (e.g., "Sample1.one").

## Importing Namespaces

Before we begin coding, let's import the necessary namespaces to access the functionalities provided by Aspose.Note:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Note;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
```

## Step 1: Load the Document

Firstly, we need to load the document that contains the tables from which we want to extract text. Ensure you replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual path to your document directory.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document document = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one");
```

## Step 2: Get Table Nodes

Next, we retrieve a list of table nodes from the loaded document.

```csharp
IList<Table> nodes = document.GetChildNodes<Table>();
```

## Step 3: Iterate Through Tables, Rows, and Cells

Now, we'll loop through each table, row, and cell to extract the text.

```csharp
foreach (Table table in nodes)
{
    foreach (TableRow row in table)
    {
        foreach (TableCell cell in row)
        {
            // Retrieve text from each cell
            string text = string.Join(Environment.NewLine, cell.GetChildNodes<RichText>().Select(e => e.Text)) + Environment.NewLine;

            // Print the extracted text
            Console.WriteLine(text);
        }
    }
}
```
