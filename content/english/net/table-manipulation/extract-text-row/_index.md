## Introduction

In the realm of document processing, Aspose.Note for .NET stands as a robust solution that empowers developers to efficiently manipulate OneNote files programmatically. Among its myriad capabilities, extracting text from table rows is a common task developers encounter. This tutorial will guide you through the process of extracting text from table rows using Aspose.Note for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language is essential to understand the code snippets provided in this tutorial.
2. Installation of Aspose.Note for .NET: Make sure you have Aspose.Note for .NET installed in your development environment. You can download the library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).
3. Development Environment Setup: Set up your development environment with Visual Studio or any preferred C# IDE.

## Import Namespaces

Firstly, you need to import the necessary namespaces to leverage Aspose.Note for .NET functionalities in your code. Add the following namespaces at the beginning of your C# file:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Note;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
```

Let's break down the process of extracting text from table rows in Aspose.Note for .NET into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Load the Document

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load the document into Aspose.Note.
Document document = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one");
```

In this step, we load the target OneNote document into an instance of the `Document` class provided by Aspose.Note.

## Step 2: Retrieve Table Nodes

```csharp
// Get a list of table nodes
IList<Table> nodes = document.GetChildNodes<Table>();
```

Here, we retrieve a list of table nodes from the document using the `GetChildNodes<Table>()` method.

## Step 3: Extract Text from Table Rows

```csharp
foreach (Table table in nodes)
{
	// Iterate through table rows
	foreach (TableRow row in table)
	{
		// Retrieve text
		string text = string.Join(Environment.NewLine, row.GetChildNodes<RichText>().Select(e => e.Text)) + Environment.NewLine;
   
		// Print text on the output screen
		Console.WriteLine(text);
	}
}
```

This step involves iterating through each table row and extracting text from it. We use LINQ to select the text from each `RichText` node within the row and join them using `Environment.NewLine` as a separator.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to extract text from table rows in Aspose.Note for .NET. By following the provided steps, you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your C# applications, enhancing their document processing capabilities.
