## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to extract text from tables in Aspose.Note using C# with the .NET framework. Aspose.Note is a powerful API that allows developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically, enabling various operations such as creating, reading, manipulating, and converting OneNote documents.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

1. Basic knowledge of C# programming language.
2. Visual Studio or any other C# IDE installed on your system.
3. Aspose.Note for .NET library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).
4. A sample OneNote document containing tables for text extraction.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, let's import the necessary namespaces:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Note;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
```

## Step 1: Load the OneNote Document

The first step is to load the OneNote document into Aspose.Note:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load the document into Aspose.Note.
Document document = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one");
```

## Step 2: Get Table Nodes

Next, we need to get a list of table nodes from the loaded document:

```csharp
// Get a list of table nodes
IList<Table> nodes = document.GetChildNodes<Table>();
```

## Step 3: Extract Text from Tables

Now, iterate through each table node and extract text from them:

```csharp
// Set table count
int tblCount = 0;

foreach (Table table in nodes)
{
    tblCount++;
    Console.WriteLine("table # " + tblCount);

    // Retrieve text
    string text = string.Join(Environment.NewLine, table.GetChildNodes<RichText>().Select(e => e.Text)) + Environment.NewLine;

    // Print text on the output screen
    Console.WriteLine(text);
}
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've learned how to extract text from tables in Aspose.Note using C#. With the provided code snippets and explanations, you can now integrate text extraction functionality into your .NET applications effortlessly.
