## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll delve into the world of document manipulation using Aspose.Note for .NET. Aspose.Note is a powerful API that allows developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically, enabling tasks such as creating, modifying, and converting documents with ease. 

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Visual Studio: Make sure you have Visual Studio installed on your system. Aspose.Note for .NET works seamlessly with Visual Studio, providing a robust development environment.

2. Aspose.Note for .NET: Download and install Aspose.Note for .NET. You can find the download link [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).

3. Basic Understanding of C#: Familiarize yourself with C# programming language basics. While this tutorial provides step-by-step guidance, having a foundational knowledge of C# will be beneficial.

## Import Namespaces

Let's start by importing the necessary namespaces into your C# project. These namespaces contain classes and methods that we'll use to perform document manipulation tasks.

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Note;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Drawing;
using System;
```

Now, let's break down the process of building a document and inserting an image into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Create Document Object

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
```

This line of code initializes a new instance of the `Document` class, which represents a OneNote document.

## Step 2: Initialize Page Object

```csharp
Aspose.Note.Page page = new Aspose.Note.Page(doc);
```

Here, we initialize a new instance of the `Page` class, which represents a page within the OneNote document.

## Step 3: Initialize Outline Object

```csharp
Outline outline = new Outline(doc);
```

The `Outline` class represents an outline node in the document hierarchy. We create a new outline object to structure our document.

## Step 4: Initialize OutlineElement Object

```csharp
OutlineElement outlineElem = new OutlineElement(doc);
```

An `OutlineElement` represents an element within an outline. Here, we create a new outline element to add content to our document.

## Step 5: Load Image

```csharp
Aspose.Note.Image image = new Aspose.Note.Image(doc, dataDir + "image.jpg");
```

We load an image file from the specified path using the `Image` class constructor.

## Step 6: Set Image Alignment

```csharp
image.Alignment = HorizontalAlignment.Right;
```

This line of code sets the alignment of the image within the document. In this example, we align the image to the right.

## Step 7: Add Image to Outline Element

```csharp
outlineElem.AppendChildLast(image);
```

Here, we add the image to the outline element, placing it within the document structure.

## Step 8: Add Outline Element to Outline

```csharp
outline.AppendChildLast(outlineElem);
```

We add the outline element, along with the inserted image, to the outline structure of the document.

## Step 9: Add Outline to Page

```csharp
page.AppendChildLast(outline);
```

The outline, containing the image, is added to the page structure of the document.

## Step 10: Add Page to Document

```csharp
doc.AppendChildLast(page);
```

Finally, we add the page, complete with its content, to the document.

## Step 11: Save Document

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir + "BuildDocAndInsertImage_out.one");
```

This line saves the modified document to the specified location.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully learned how to build a document and insert an image using Aspose.Note for .NET. With this newfound knowledge, you can explore further and implement more advanced document manipulation tasks.
