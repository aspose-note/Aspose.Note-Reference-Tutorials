## Step-by-Step Guide: Replacing Text on All Pages in Aspose.Note for .NET
## Step 1: Specify the Document Directory
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path where your OneNote documents are stored.
## Step 2: Define Replacements Dictionary
```csharp
Dictionary<string, string> replacements = new Dictionary<string, string>();
replacements.Add("Some task here", "New Text Here");
```
Create a dictionary with the text to be replaced as keys and the new text as values.
## Step 3: Load the Document
```csharp
Document oneFile = new Document(dataDir + "Aspose.one");
```
Load the targeted OneNote document into Aspose.Note.
## Step 4: Retrieve RichText Nodes
```csharp
IList<RichText> textNodes = oneFile.GetChildNodes<RichText>();
```
Get all RichText nodes from the loaded document.
## Step 5: Iterate and Replace Text
```csharp
foreach (RichText richText in textNodes)
{
    foreach (KeyValuePair<string, string> kvp in replacements)
    {
        richText.Replace(kvp.Key, kvp.Value);
    }
}
```
Iterate through each RichText node and replace the specified text.
## Step 6: Save the Modified Document
```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "ReplaceTextOnAllPages_out.pdf";
oneFile.Save(dataDir, SaveFormat.Pdf);
```
Save the modified document in the desired format, in this case, as a PDF file.
## Step 7: Display Success Message
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nText replaced successfully on all pages.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
```
Inform the user that the text replacement process was successful.
