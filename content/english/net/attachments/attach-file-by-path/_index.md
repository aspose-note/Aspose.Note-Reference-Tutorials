## Attach File by Path in Aspose.Note

Attaching files to a OneNote document using Aspose.Note for .NET is a straightforward process. Let's break it down into multiple steps:

### Step 1: Initialize Document Object

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
```

This initializes a new instance of the `Document` class, which represents a OneNote document.

### Step 2: Initialize Page Object

```csharp
Aspose.Note.Page page = new Aspose.Note.Page(doc);
```

Here, we create a new instance of the `Page` class, which represents a page within the document.

### Step 3: Initialize Outline Object

```csharp
Outline outline = new Outline(doc);
```

An `Outline` object is created to organize the content within the page.

### Step 4: Initialize OutlineElement Object

```csharp
OutlineElement outlineElem = new OutlineElement(doc);
```

`OutlineElement` represents an element within the outline structure.

### Step 5: Initialize AttachedFile Object

```csharp
AttachedFile attachedFile = new AttachedFile(doc,  dataDir + "attachment.txt");
```

Here, we create an instance of `AttachedFile`, specifying the path to the file we want to attach.

### Step 6: Append Attached File

```csharp
outlineElem.AppendChildLast(attachedFile);
```

The attached file is appended to the outline element.

### Step 7: Append Outline Element

```csharp
outline.AppendChildLast(outlineElem);
```

The outline element is appended to the outline.

### Step 8: Append Outline

```csharp
page.AppendChildLast(outline);
```

The outline is appended to the page.

### Step 9: Append Page

```csharp
doc.AppendChildLast(page);
```

Finally, the page is appended to the document.

### Step 10: Save Document

```csharp
doc.Save(dataDir);
```

The document is saved, and the file is attached successfully.
