## Introduction

Aspose.Note for .NET is a powerful library that enables developers to create, manipulate, and convert Microsoft OneNote files programmatically using the .NET framework. In this tutorial, we will explore how to add a text node with a tag to a OneNote document using Aspose.Note for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Visual Studio: Ensure that you have Visual Studio installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Note for .NET: Download and install Aspose.Note for .NET from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarize yourself with C# programming language fundamentals.

## Import Namespaces

First, you need to import the necessary namespaces to access the classes and methods required for working with Aspose.Note for .NET.

```csharp
using System.Drawing;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Note;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```

## Step 1: Create a Document Object

Initialize a Document object to start working with a OneNote document.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document doc = new Document();
```

## Step 2: Initialize Page and Outline Objects

Create Page and Outline objects to structure the content of the OneNote document.

```csharp
Aspose.Note.Page page = new Aspose.Note.Page(doc);
Outline outline = new Outline(doc);
```

## Step 3: Add Text Node with Tag

Create a RichText object with the desired text and style, and then add it to the OutlineElement.

```csharp
OutlineElement outlineElem = new OutlineElement(doc);
ParagraphStyle textStyle = new ParagraphStyle { FontColor = Color.Black, FontName = "Arial", FontSize = 10 };
RichText text = new RichText(doc) { Text = "OneNote text.", ParagraphStyle = textStyle };
text.Tags.Add(NoteTag.CreateYellowStar());
outlineElem.AppendChildLast(text);
```

## Step 4: Append Outline Element and Page Nodes

Append the OutlineElement to the Outline, and then append the Outline to the Page. Finally, append the Page to the Document.

```csharp
outline.AppendChildLast(outlineElem);
page.AppendChildLast(outline);
doc.AppendChildLast(page);
```

## Step 5: Save the Document

Save the modified OneNote document to a specified location.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
string outputPath = Path.Combine(dataDir, "AddTextNodeWithTag_out.one");
doc.Save(outputPath);
```
