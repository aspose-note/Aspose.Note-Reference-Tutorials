Iterate through each RichText node to check for tags.

```csharp
// Iterate through each node
foreach (RichText richText in nodes)
{
    var tags = richText.Tags.OfType<NoteTag>();
    if (tags.Any())
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Text: {richText.Text}");
        foreach (var noteTag in tags)
        {
            // Retrieve properties
            Console.WriteLine($"    Completed Time: {noteTag.CompletedTime}");
            Console.WriteLine($"    Create Time: {noteTag.CreationTime}");
            Console.WriteLine($"    Font Color: {noteTag.FontColor}");
            Console.WriteLine($"    Status: {noteTag.Status}");
            Console.WriteLine($"    Label: {noteTag.Label}");
            Console.WriteLine($"    Icon: {noteTag.Icon}");
            Console.WriteLine($"    High Light: {noteTag.Highlight}");
        }
    }
}
```
