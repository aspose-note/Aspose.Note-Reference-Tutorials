## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use Aspose.Note for .NET to open and close projects with tags. Aspose.Note is a powerful API that allows developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically, enabling tasks such as manipulating text, images, and tags within the documents.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up:

## Import Namespaces

```csharp
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
```

Now let's break down each example into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Load the Document

First, we need to load the document into Aspose.Note.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
var oneFile = new Document(Path.Combine(dataDir, "ProjectNotes.one"));
```

## Step 2: Close Project C Items

Now, let's close all checkbox items related to 'Project C'.

```csharp
foreach (var node in oneFile.GetChildNodes<ITaggable>())
{
    foreach (var checkBox in node.Tags.OfType<CheckBox>())
    {
        if (checkBox.Label.Contains("Project C") && !checkBox.Checked)
        {
            checkBox.SetCompleted();
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Save the Closed Project C Notes

Save the modified document with closed 'Project C' items.

```csharp
oneFile.Save("Path to save the closed Project C notes");
```

## Step 4: Open Project C Items

Next, let's open all checkbox items related to 'Project C'.

```csharp
var oneFile = new Document("Path to the closed Project C notes");

foreach (var node in oneFile.GetChildNodes<ITaggable>())
{
    foreach (var checkBox in node.Tags.OfType<CheckBox>())
    {
        if (checkBox.Label.Contains("Project C") && checkBox.Checked)
        {
            checkBox.SetOpen();
        }
    }
}
```

## Step 5: Save the Open Project C Notes

Save the modified document with opened 'Project C' items.

```csharp
oneFile.Save(Path.Combine(dataDir, "ProjectNoteWithOpenProjectC.one"));
```

Now you've learned how to open and close projects with tags in Aspose.Note using .NET.
