String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document oneFile = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one", options);
```

## Step 2: Get the Page

Retrieve the page in the document where you want to insert the image.

```java
Page page = oneFile.getFirstChild();
```

## Step 3: Load the Image

Load the image that you want to insert into the OneNote document.

```java
Image image = new Image(oneFile, dataDir + "Input.jpg");
```

## Step 4: Customize Image Attributes (Optional)

```java
image.setWidth(100);
image.setHeight(100);
image.setVerticalOffset(400);
image.setHorizontalOffset(100);
image.setAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Right);
```

## Step 5: Add Image to the Page

Add the image to the page in the OneNote document.

```java
page.appendChildLast(image);
```

## Step 6: Save the Document

Save the modified document, including the inserted image.

```java
try {
    oneFile.save(dataDir + "InsertanImage_out.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf);
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
