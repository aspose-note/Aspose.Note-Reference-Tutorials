## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to utilize Aspose.Note for Java to push the current page version in OneNote. Aspose.Note is a powerful Java library that allows developers to work with Microsoft OneNote documents programmatically, enabling various operations such as creating, manipulating, and converting OneNote files.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Basic knowledge of Java programming language.
2. Installed Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system.
3. Aspose.Note for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).
4. A sample OneNote document to work with.

## Import Packages

First, you need to import the necessary packages in your Java project to use Aspose.Note functionalities.

```java
import java.io.IOException;

import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.Page;
import com.aspose.note.PageHistory;
```

## Step 1: Load the OneNote Document

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document document = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one");
```

Here, `dataDir` should point to the directory where your OneNote document is located. Replace `"Sample1.one"` with the name of your OneNote file.

## Step 2: Get the Current Page and its History

```java
Page page = document.getFirstChild();
PageHistory pageHistory = document.getPageHistory(page);
```

We retrieve the first page of the document using `getFirstChild()` and then obtain its history using `getPageHistory()`.

## Step 3: Push the Current Page Version

```java
pageHistory.addItem(page.deepClone());
```

Here, we add the current version of the page to its history by cloning it and adding it as a new item.

## Step 4: Save the Document

```java
document.save(dataDir + "PushCurrentPageVersion_out.one");
```

Finally, we save the modified document with the updated page history.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've learned how to push the current page version in OneNote using Aspose.Note for Java. By following these steps, you can effectively manage the versioning of your OneNote documents programmatically.
