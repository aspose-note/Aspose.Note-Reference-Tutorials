# Conflict Page Manipulation in OneNote - Aspose.Note

## Introduction

OneNote users often encounter conflicts when multiple users edit the same page simultaneously. Resolving these conflicts efficiently is crucial to maintaining document integrity. Aspose.Note for Java offers powerful tools to manage conflict pages seamlessly. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to manipulate conflict pages using Aspose.Note for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into conflict page manipulation, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Install JDK to compile and run Java programs.
2. Aspose.Note for Java: Download and install Aspose.Note for Java from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose an IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for Java development.

## Import Packages

Begin by importing the necessary packages into your Java project:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.text.DateFormat;
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;

import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.LoadOptions;
import com.aspose.note.Page;
import com.aspose.note.PageHistory;
import com.aspose.note.SaveFormat;

```

## Step 1: Load the Document

First, load the document into Aspose.Note:

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Load the document into Aspose.Note
LoadOptions options = new LoadOptions();
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Aspose.one", options);
```

## Step 2: Retrieve Page History

Next, retrieve the page history to identify conflict pages:

```java
PageHistory history = doc.getPageHistory(doc.getFirstChild());
```

## Step 3: Iterate Through History

Iterate through the page history to analyze each revision:

```java
DateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat("dd.MM.yyyy HH.mm.ss");

for (int i = 0; i < history.size(); i++)
{
    Page historyPage = history.get_Item(i);
    System.out.format(" %d. Author: %s, %s",
            i,
            historyPage.getPageContentRevisionSummary().getAuthorMostRecent(),
            df.format(historyPage.getPageContentRevisionSummary().getLastModifiedTime()));
    System.out.println(historyPage.isConflictPage() ? ", IsConflict: true" : "");
    // By default conflict pages are just skipped on saving.
    // If mark it as non-conflict then it will be saved as usual one in the history.
    if (historyPage.isConflictPage())
        historyPage.setConflictPage(false);
}
```

## Step 4: Save Changes

Save the manipulated document:

```java
doc.save(dataDir + "ConflictPageManipulation_out.one", SaveFormat.One);
//ExEnd: ConflictPageManipulation
```

Congratulations! You've successfully manipulated conflict pages in OneNote using Aspose.Note for Java.
