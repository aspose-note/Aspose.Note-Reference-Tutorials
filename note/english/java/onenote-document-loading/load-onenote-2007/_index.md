# Load OneNote 2007 Document - Java

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll delve into using Aspose.Note for Java to load OneNote 2007 documents seamlessly. Aspose.Note is a powerful Java library that allows developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically, enabling a wide range of applications from document manipulation to automation. By the end of this guide, you'll be equipped with the knowledge to effortlessly load OneNote 2007 documents in your Java applications.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

### Java Development Environment Setup

Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download and install the latest version of JDK from the Oracle website.

### Aspose.Note for Java Library

Download and include the Aspose.Note for Java library in your Java project. You can obtain the library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).

## Import Packages

To get started with loading OneNote 2007 documents using Aspose.Note for Java, you need to import the necessary packages:

```java
import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.FileFormat;
import com.aspose.note.UnsupportedFileFormatException;
```

Now, let's break down the process of loading a OneNote 2007 document into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Define Document Directory

First, define the directory where your OneNote 2007 document is located. This directory path will be used to locate and load the document.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

## Step 2: Load OneNote 2007 Document

Now, let's load the OneNote 2007 document into Aspose.Note for Java. This step involves using the `Document` class to load the document from the specified directory.

```java
// ExStart:LoadOneNote2007
// Load the document into Aspose.Note.
try {
    new Document(dataDir + "OneNote2007.one");
}
catch (UnsupportedFileFormatException e)
{
    if (e.getFileFormat() == FileFormat.OneNote2007)
    {
        System.out.println("It looks like the provided file is in OneNote 2007 format that is not supported.");
    }
    else
        throw e;
}
// ExEnd:LoadOneNote2007
```

In this step, the provided OneNote 2007 document is loaded into Aspose.Note. The `Document` constructor takes the file path as a parameter, allowing seamless loading of the document.

## Step 3: Handle Unsupported File Format

It's essential to handle any unsupported file formats gracefully. In case the provided file is in an unsupported format, catch the `UnsupportedFileFormatException` and handle it accordingly.

```java
catch (UnsupportedFileFormatException e)
{
    if (e.getFileFormat() == FileFormat.OneNote2007)
    {
        System.out.println("It looks like the provided file is in OneNote 2007 format that is not supported.");
    }
    else
        throw e;
}
```
