# Distinguish Node Type in OneNote Document - Java

## Introduction

In the realm of Java programming, working with OneNote documents presents its own set of challenges and intricacies. Fortunately, Aspose.Note for Java provides a comprehensive solution to navigate, manipulate, and extract data from these documents seamlessly. In this tutorial, we will delve into one specific aspect: distinguishing node types within a OneNote document using Java. By the end of this guide, you will have a solid understanding of how to identify different node types and leverage this knowledge effectively in your Java applications.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

### Java Development Environment Setup

1. Install JDK: Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download and install the latest version from the Oracle website.

2. IDE Installation: Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans. Install the IDE of your preference and set it up for Java development.

3. Aspose.Note for Java: Download and install Aspose.Note for Java library from the provided [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/). Follow the installation instructions to integrate it into your Java project.

## Import Packages

Before we start working with OneNote documents in Java, let's import the necessary packages to our project:

```java
import com.aspose.note.Document;
```

Let's break down the example provided into multiple steps for a clear understanding:

## Step 1: Create a New Document Object

```java
Document doc = new Document();
```

This line initializes a new `Document` object, which represents a OneNote document.

## Step 2: Determine the Node Type

```java
System.out.println(doc.getNodeType());
```

Here, we use the `getNodeType()` method to retrieve the type of the document node and print it out. This helps us distinguish the type of node, whether it's a Document node, Page node, or any other specific type.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've explored how to distinguish node types within a OneNote document using Java with Aspose.Note. By following these steps, you can effectively identify and work with different types of nodes in your Java applications, opening up a wide range of possibilities for document manipulation and extraction.
