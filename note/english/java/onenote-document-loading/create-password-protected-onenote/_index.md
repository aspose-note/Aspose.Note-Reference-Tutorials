# Create Password-Protected OneNote Documents - Java

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of creating password-protected OneNote documents using Java with the help of Aspose.Note. Security is paramount when dealing with sensitive information, and password protection offers an effective layer of defense against unauthorized access. We'll guide you through each step, ensuring that you can seamlessly implement this crucial security feature into your Java applications.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Note for Java: Download and install Aspose.Note for Java from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose your preferred IDE for Java development, such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.

## Import Packages

To get started, import the necessary packages:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.OneSaveOptions;
```

## Step 1: Load the Document

Firstly, load the document into Aspose.Note. Ensure that you replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual directory path where your OneNote document is located.

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document document = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one");
```

## Step 2: Set Password and Save

Next, define the save options and set the document password. This password will be required to access the protected document.

```java
OneSaveOptions saveOptions = new OneSaveOptions();
saveOptions.setDocumentPassword("YourPassword");
```

Then, save the document with the specified password protection.

```java
document.save(dataDir + "CreatePasswordProtected_out.one", saveOptions);
```

That's it! You've successfully created a password-protected OneNote document using Java with Aspose.Note.
