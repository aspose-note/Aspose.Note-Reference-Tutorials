# Get Outlook Task in OneNote - Aspose.Note

## Introduction
Welcome to our comprehensive guide on using Aspose.Note for Java to retrieve Outlook tasks in OneNote seamlessly. Aspose.Note is a powerful Java API that allows developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files effortlessly. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process of extracting Outlook tasks from a OneNote document step by step.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java Development Environment: Ensure that you have a Java development environment set up on your machine.
- Aspose.Note Library: Download and install the Aspose.Note for Java library. You can find the library [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).
## Import Packages
To get started, import the necessary packages into your Java project. Add the following lines to your code:
```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.List;
import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.ITag;
import com.aspose.note.NoteTask;
import com.aspose.note.RichText;

```
Now, let's break down the process into manageable steps:
## Step 1: Set up Your Document Directory
Define the directory where your OneNote document is located:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Load the OneNote Document
Load the OneNote document using Aspose.Note:
```java
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one");
```
## Step 3: Get All RichText Nodes
Retrieve all RichText nodes from the document:
```java
List<RichText> nodes = (List<RichText>) doc.getChildNodes(RichText.class);
```
## Step 4: Iterate Through Each Node
Iterate through each RichText node and check for NoteTask tags:
```java
for (RichText richText : nodes) {
    for (ITag tag : richText.getTags()) {
        if (tag.getClass() == NoteTask.class) {
            NoteTask noteTask = (NoteTask) tag;
            
            // Retrieve properties
            System.out.println("Completed Time: " + noteTask.getCompletedTime());
            System.out.println("Create Time: " + noteTask.getCreationTime());
            System.out.println("Due Date: " + noteTask.getDueDate());
            System.out.println("Status: " + noteTask.getStatus());
            System.out.println("Icon: " + noteTask.getIcon());
        }
    }
}
```
