# Save to BMP Image Using Image Save Options in OneNote

## Introduction

Aspose.Note for Java is a powerful library that enables Java developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically. With Aspose.Note for Java, you can create, manipulate, and convert OneNote documents seamlessly. In this tutorial, we will delve into how to save a OneNote document to a BMP image using the Image Save Options provided by Aspose.Note for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this tutorial, ensure that you have the following:

1. Basic knowledge of Java programming language.
2. Installed JDK (Java Development Kit) on your system.
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
4. Aspose.Note for Java library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).

## Import Packages

First, you need to import the necessary packages from Aspose.Note for Java to utilize its functionalities. Add the following import statement to your Java file:

```java
import com.aspose.note.*;
import java.io.IOException;
```

Now, let's break down the example provided into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Load the Document

```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load the document into Aspose.Note.
Document oneFile = new Document(dataDir + "Aspose.one");
```

In this step, we specify the path to the directory where our OneNote document is located. Then, we load the document using the `Document` class provided by Aspose.Note for Java.

## Step 2: Save to BMP Image

```java
dataDir = dataDir + "SaveToBmpImageUsingImageSaveOptions_out.bmp";

// Save the document.
oneFile.save(dataDir, new ImageSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Bmp));
```

In this step, we specify the output path for the BMP image that will be generated from the OneNote document. We use the `save` method of the `Document` class to save the document as a BMP image, providing the output path and an instance of `ImageSaveOptions` with the desired `SaveFormat` (in this case, `SaveFormat.Bmp`).

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to save a OneNote document to a BMP image using Aspose.Note for Java. By following the step-by-step guide, you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your Java applications, enabling you to manipulate OneNote documents with ease.
