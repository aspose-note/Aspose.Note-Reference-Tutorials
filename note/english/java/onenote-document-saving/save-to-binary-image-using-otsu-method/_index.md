# Save to Binary Image Using Otsu Method in OneNote

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will learn how to save a document as a binary image using the Otsu method in Aspose.Note for Java. Aspose.Note is a powerful API that enables Java developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically. Saving documents as binary images can be useful for various applications such as image processing, OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and more.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:
1. Basic knowledge of Java programming language.
2. JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your system.
3. Aspose.Note for Java library downloaded and configured in your Java project.

## Import Packages

To get started, you need to import the necessary packages in your Java class:
```java
import com.aspose.note.*;
import java.io.IOException;
```

## Step 1: Load the Document

The first step is to load the document you want to convert to a binary image using Aspose.Note.
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Load the document into Aspose.Note.
Document oneFile = new Document(dataDir + "Aspose.one");
```

## Step 2: Set Binarization Options
Next, we need to specify the binarization method. In this example, we'll use the Otsu method.
```java
dataDir = dataDir + "SaveToBinaryImageUsingOtsuMethod_out.png";
ImageBinarizationOptions binarizationOptions = new ImageBinarizationOptions();
binarizationOptions.setBinarizationMethod(BinarizationMethod.Otsu);
```

## Step 3: Set Image Save Options
Now, we'll configure the options for saving the document as an image. We'll set the color mode to black and white and provide the binarization options we defined earlier.
```java
ImageSaveOptions options = new ImageSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Png);
options.setColorMode(ColorMode.BlackAndWhite);
options.setBinarizationOptions(binarizationOptions);
```

## Step 4: Save the Document as Binary Image
Finally, we'll save the document as a binary image using the specified options.
```java
// Save the document.
oneFile.save(dataDir, options);
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we've learned how to save a document as a binary image using the Otsu method in Aspose.Note for Java. This functionality can be valuable for various image processing tasks in Java applications.
