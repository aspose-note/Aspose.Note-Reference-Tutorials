## Introduction
Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on extracting row text from tables in OneNote documents using Aspose.Note for Java. Aspose.Note is a powerful Java library that enables developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files seamlessly. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process step by step, demonstrating how to efficiently extract row text from tables in your OneNote documents.
## Prerequisites
Before we dive into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.Note for Java Library: Ensure that you have the Aspose.Note for Java library installed. You can download it from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).
- Java Development Environment: Make sure you have a Java development environment set up on your machine.
- OneNote Document: Prepare a sample OneNote document (e.g., "Sample1.one") containing tables from which you want to extract row text.
## Import Packages
In your Java project, import the necessary Aspose.Note packages. This ensures that you have access to the classes and methods required for working with OneNote documents.
```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.LoadOptions;
import com.aspose.note.RichText;
import com.aspose.note.Table;
import com.aspose.note.TableRow;
```
## Step 1: Set Document Directory
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
## Step 2: Load OneNote Document
```java
// Load the document into Aspose.Note.
Document document = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one", new LoadOptions());
```
## Step 3: Get Table Nodes
```java
// Get a list of table nodes
List<Table> nodes = (List<Table>) document.getChildNodes(Table.class);
```
## Step 4: Iterate Through Tables and Rows
```java
// Set row count
int rowCount = 0;
for (Table table : nodes) {
    // Iterate through table rows
    for (TableRow row : table) {
        rowCount++;
        // Retrieve text
        List<RichText> textNodes = (List<RichText>) row.getChildNodes(RichText.class);
        StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder();
        for (RichText richText : textNodes) {
            text = text.append(richText.getText().toString());
        }
        // Print text on the output screen
        System.out.println(text);
    }
}
```
Repeat these steps for each table in your OneNote document, and you'll successfully extract row text.
