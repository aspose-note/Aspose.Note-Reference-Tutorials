# Get Cell Text From Row Of Table in OneNote - Aspose.Note

## Introduction
Embark on a journey into the realm of Java development as we unravel the process of extracting text from OneNote table rows using the powerful Aspose.Note library. This step-by-step guide will equip you with the skills to efficiently navigate and manipulate text within tables.
## Prerequisites
Before we delve into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites ready:
- Java Development Environment: Set up a Java development environment on your system.
- Aspose.Note for Java: Download and install Aspose.Note for Java from [this link](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).
- Sample OneNote Document: Have a sample OneNote document, such as "Sample1.one," stored in your document directory.
## Import Packages
Let's kick off by importing the necessary Aspose.Note packages to leverage its powerful features in your Java project:
```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;
import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.RichText;
import com.aspose.note.Table;
import com.aspose.note.TableCell;
import com.aspose.note.TableRow;
```
## Step 1: Load OneNote Document
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Load the document into Aspose.Note.
Document document = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one");
// Get a list of table nodes
List<Table> nodes = (List<Table>) document.getChildNodes(Table.class);
```
## Step 2: Iterate Through Tables
Navigate through tables in your OneNote document using the following code:
```java
for (Table table : nodes) {
    // Iterate through table rows
    for (TableRow row : table) {
        // Get list of TableCell nodes
        List<TableCell> cellNodes = (List<TableCell>) row.getChildNodes(TableCell.class);
        
        // Iterate through table cells
        for (TableCell cell : cellNodes) {
            // Retrieve text
            List<RichText> textNodes = (List<RichText>) cell.getChildNodes(RichText.class);
            StringBuilder text = new StringBuilder();
            
            // Step 2: Retrieve Text from RichText Nodes
            for (RichText richText : textNodes) {
                text = text.append(richText.getText().toString());
            }
            
            // Step 3: Print Text
            System.out.println(text);
        }
    }
}
```
