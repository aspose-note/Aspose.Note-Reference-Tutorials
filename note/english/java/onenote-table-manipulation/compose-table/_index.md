## Introduction
In today's competitive business environment, effective communication and collaboration are key factors in achieving success. Aspose.Note for Java provides a powerful solution for creating and manipulating OneNote documents programmatically. In this tutorial, we will explore how to compose tables in OneNote using Aspose.Note for Java. Follow the step-by-step guide below to enhance your document creation process.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
- Basic knowledge of Java programming.
- Aspose.Note for Java library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).
- An integrated development environment (IDE) set up for Java development.
## Import Packages
Make sure to import the necessary packages to kickstart your project. Add the following import statements to your Java class:
```java
import com.aspose.note.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.util.stream.StreamSupport;
```
## Step 1: Set Document Directory
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```
Ensure to replace "Your Document Directory" with the actual path where you want to save your OneNote document.
## Step 2: Compose Header
```java
RichText headerText = new RichText().append("Super contest for suppliers.");
headerText.setParagraphStyle(new ParagraphStyle().setFontSize(18).setBold(true));
headerText.setAlignment(HorizontalAlignment.Center);
```
Create an eye-catching header for your document. Adjust the font size, boldness, and alignment as needed.
## Step 3: Create Page and Outline
```java
Page page = new Page();
Outline outline = page.appendChildLast(new Outline());
outline.setHorizontalOffset(50);
outline.appendChildLast(new OutlineElement()).appendChildLast(headerText);
```
Set up a new page and outline, then add the previously created header to the outline.
## Step 4: Add Summary Text
```java
RichText bodyTextHeader = outline.appendChildLast(new OutlineElement()).appendChildLast(new RichText());
bodyTextHeader.setParagraphStyle(ParagraphStyle.getDefault());
bodyTextHeader.append("This is the final ranking of proposals got from our suppliers.");
```
Include a brief summary text to provide context for the table.
## Step 5: Compose Table
```java
Table ranking = outline.appendChildLast(new OutlineElement()).appendChildLast(new Table());
// Remaining steps are involved in setting up the table structure, header row, and adding empty rows.
// Refer to the provided code for detailed implementation.
```
Compose the table structure and populate it with relevant information. The provided code includes adding columns, header row, empty rows, and template content for the 'Contacts' column.
## Step 6: Save Document
```java
Document d = new Document();
d.appendChildLast(page);
d.save(Paths.get(dataDir, "ComposeTable_out.one").toString());
```
Save your composed document with a specified filename and directory path.
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully composed a table in OneNote using Aspose.Note for Java. This tutorial demonstrated the step-by-step process, empowering you to enhance your document creation capabilities programmatically.
