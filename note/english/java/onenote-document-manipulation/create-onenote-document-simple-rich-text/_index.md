## Prerequisites

Before diving into the tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Install JDK version 1.8 or above on your system.
   
2. Aspose.Note for Java Library: Download and install Aspose.Note for Java library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).
   
3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Have an IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA installed for Java development.

## Import Packages

Firstly, import the necessary packages to utilize Aspose.Note for Java functionalities.

```java
import java.awt.Color;
import java.io.IOException;
import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.Outline;
import com.aspose.note.OutlineElement;
import com.aspose.note.Page;
import com.aspose.note.RichText;
import com.aspose.note.SaveFormat;
import com.aspose.note.ParagraphStyle;
```

Now, let's break down the process of creating a OneNote document with simple rich text into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Set Document Directory

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path where you want to save the created OneNote document.

## Step 2: Initialize Document Object

```java
Document doc = new Document();
```

Create an instance of the `Document` class, which represents a OneNote document.

## Step 3: Initialize Page Object

```java
Page page = new Page();
```

Instantiate a `Page` object, representing a page within the OneNote document.

## Step 4: Initialize Outline Object

```java
Outline outline = new Outline();
```

Create an `Outline` object, which serves as the container for outline elements.

## Step 5: Initialize OutlineElement Object

```java
OutlineElement outlineElem = new OutlineElement();
```

Instantiate an `OutlineElement` object, representing an individual element within the outline.

## Step 6: Set Text Style

```java
ParagraphStyle textStyle = new ParagraphStyle()
                                    .setFontColor(Color.black)
                                    .setFontName("Arial")
                                    .setFontSize(10);
```

Define a `ParagraphStyle` object to specify the formatting properties for the text.

## Step 7: Initialize RichText Object

```java
RichText text = new RichText().append("Hello OneNote text!");
text.setParagraphStyle(textStyle);
```

Create a `RichText` object and apply the specified text style to it.

## Step 8: Add RichText Node to OutlineElement

```java
outlineElem.appendChildLast(text);
```

Add the `RichText` node to the `OutlineElement`.

## Step 9: Add OutlineElement Node to Outline

```java
outline.appendChildLast(outlineElem);
```

Append the `OutlineElement` node to the `Outline`.

## Step 10: Add Outline Node to Page

```java
page.appendChildLast(outline);
```

Add the `Outline` node to the `Page`.

## Step 11: Add Page Node to Document

```java
doc.appendChildLast(page);
```

Attach the `Page` node to the `Document`.

## Step 12: Save the Document

```java
doc.save(dataDir + "CreateOneNoteDocumentWithSimpleRichText_out.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf);
```

Save the created OneNote document to the specified directory in PDF format.
