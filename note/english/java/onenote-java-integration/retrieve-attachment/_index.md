Retrieve the list of attachments present in the OneNote document.

## Step 4: Retrieve and Save Attachments

```java
for (AttachedFile a : attachments) {
    byte[] buffer = a.getBytes();
    ByteArrayInputStream stream = new ByteArrayInputStream(buffer);
    String outputFile = "Output_" + a.getFileName();
    Path outputPath = Utils.getPath(RetrieveAttachment.class, outputFile);
    Files.copy(stream, outputPath, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
    System.out.println("File saved: " + outputPath);
