# Set Proofing Language for Text in OneNote - Aspose.Note

## Introduction
In the dynamic world of software development, Aspose.Note for Java stands out as a powerful tool for managing and manipulating OneNote documents programmatically. If you're looking to enhance your Java applications with the ability to set proofing language for text in OneNote, you've come to the right place. This tutorial will guide you through the process step by step, ensuring you grasp each concept clearly.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
1. Java Development Environment: Ensure you have a Java development environment set up on your machine.
2. Aspose.Note for Java Library: Download and install the Aspose.Note for Java library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).
3. Document Directory: Create a directory for your documents to store the output file.
## Import Packages
Start by importing the necessary packages to kickstart your development process. Here's a snippet of code to help you get started:
```java
import com.aspose.note.*;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.util.Locale;
```
## Step 1: Set Up Document and Page
Create a new document and page to work with. This will serve as the foundation for your OneNote manipulation.
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document document = new Document();
Page page = new Page();
```
## Step 2: Create Outline and Outline Element
Construct an outline and outline element within your page structure. This is where your text with proofing language settings will reside.
```java
Outline outline = new Outline();
OutlineElement outlineElem = new OutlineElement();
```
## Step 3: Add Rich Text with Language Settings
Integrate rich text into your outline element, specifying the proofing language for each segment of text.
```java
RichText text = new RichText()
                        .append("United States", new TextStyle().setLanguage(Locale.forLanguageTag("en-US")))
                        .append(" Germany", new TextStyle().setLanguage(Locale.forLanguageTag("de-DE")))
                        .append(" China", new TextStyle().setLanguage(Locale.forLanguageTag("zh-CN")));
text.setParagraphStyle(ParagraphStyle.getDefault());
```
## Step 4: Organize Elements and Save
Assemble the elements you've created and save your document to the specified directory.
```java
outlineElem.appendChildLast(text);
outline.appendChildLast(outlineElem);
page.appendChildLast(outline);
document.appendChildLast(page);
document.save(Paths.get(dataDir, "SetProofingLanguageForText.one").toString()); 
```
