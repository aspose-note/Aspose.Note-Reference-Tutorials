# Manage Metered License for OneNote in Java

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to manage a metered license for OneNote using Aspose.Note for Java. Metered licensing allows you to monitor and control your usage based on credits, providing a flexible and cost-effective solution.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
   
2. Aspose.Note for Java Library: You need to have the Aspose.Note for Java library. You can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).

## Import Packages

First, import the necessary packages to your Java project:

```java
import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.Metered;



import java.nio.file.Paths;
```

## Step 1: Set Up Metered License

```java
Metered metered = new Metered();
metered.setMeteredKey("MyPublicKey", "MyPrivateKey");
```

In this step, we initialize the `Metered` class and set the metered key with your public and private keys provided by Aspose.

## Step 2: Load Document and Perform Operations

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document doc = new Document(Paths.get(dataDir,"Sample1.one").toString());
doc.save(Paths.get(dataDir,"MeteredLicense.pdf").toString());
```

Here, we load the OneNote document from the specified directory and save it as a PDF file. Ensure to replace `"Your Document Directory"` with your actual directory path.

## Step 3: Check Consumption

```java
System.out.println(String.format("Credit before operation: %.02f", Metered.getConsumptionCredit()));
System.out.println(String.format("Consumption quantity before operation: %.02f", Metered.getConsumptionQuantity()));
```

This step retrieves and prints the credit and consumption quantity before and after the operation.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've learned how to manage a metered license for OneNote in Java using Aspose.Note library. Metered licensing provides flexibility and control over your usage, ensuring cost-effectiveness and efficient resource management.
