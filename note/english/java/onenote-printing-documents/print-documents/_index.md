# Print Documents in OneNote - Aspose.Note

## Introduction

Printing documents is a common requirement for various applications, including OneNote. Aspose.Note for Java provides powerful capabilities to easily print documents within your Java applications. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of printing documents in OneNote using Aspose.Note for Java.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have JDK installed on your system.
2. Aspose.Note for Java JAR: Download and include the Aspose.Note for Java library in your project. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).
3. OneNote Document: Prepare the OneNote document that you want to print.

## Import Packages

First, you need to import the necessary packages to your Java class:

```java
import javax.print.PrintException;

import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.DocumentPrintAttributeSet;
import com.aspose.note.PrintOptions;
```

## Step 1: Print a Document

Let's start by printing a document without any specific print options.

```java
public static void PrintDocument() throws PrintException {
    // Specify the directory where your document is located
    String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
    
    // Load the OneNote document
    Document document = new Document(dataDir + "YourDocument.one");
    
    // Print the document
    document.print();
}
```

## Step 2: Print a Document with Print Options

You can customize the printing process by specifying print options such as print range and printer settings.

```java
public static void PrintDocumentWithPrintOptions() throws PrintException {
    // Specify the directory where your document is located
    String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

    // Load the OneNote document
    Document document = new Document(dataDir + "YourDocument.one");

    // Define print options
    final DocumentPrintAttributeSet asposeAttr = new DocumentPrintAttributeSet("Microsoft XPS Document Writer");
    asposeAttr.setPrintRange(1, 2);

    // Print the document with specified options
    document.print(asposeAttr);
}
```

## Step 3: Print Documents with a Virtual Printer

You can also use virtual printers to print documents. Here's how to print documents with a virtual PDF printer.

```java
public static void PrintDocumentsWithVirtualPrinter() throws PrintException {
    // Specify the directory where your document is located
    String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
    Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "YourDocument.one");
     
    // Define print options for virtual printer
    final DocumentPrintAttributeSet asposeAttr = new DocumentPrintAttributeSet("doPDF 8");
    asposeAttr.setPrintRange(1, 2);
    asposeAttr.setCopies(3);
     
    PrintOptions printOptions = new PrintOptions();
    printOptions.setDocumentName("YourDocument.one");
    printOptions.setPrinterSettings(asposeAttr);
      
    // Print the document using virtual printer
    doc.print(printOptions);
}
```
