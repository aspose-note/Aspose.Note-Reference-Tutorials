# Remove Child Node in OneNote Notebook - Aspose.Note

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into the process of removing a child node in a OneNote Notebook using Aspose.Note for Java. Aspose.Note is a powerful API that allows developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically, enabling various operations such as creation, manipulation, and conversion of OneNote documents.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites set up:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have Java installed on your system. You can download and install the latest JDK from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html).

2. Aspose.Note for Java: Download and install Aspose.Note for Java library from the [website](https://purchase.aspose.com/buy). You can also obtain a free trial from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/).

3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Choose an IDE of your preference for Java development. Popular choices include IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

## Import Packages

Firstly, you need to import the necessary packages to your Java project. Here's how you can do it:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

import com.aspose.note.INotebookChildNode;
import com.aspose.note.Notebook;

import com.aspose.note.system.collections.Generic.List;
```

Now, let's break down the process of removing a child node from a OneNote Notebook into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Load the OneNote Notebook

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Notebook notebook = new Notebook(dataDir + "test.onetoc2");
```

In this step, we specify the directory where our OneNote Notebook is located and load it into a Notebook object.

## Step 2: Traverse Through Child Nodes

```java
for (INotebookChildNode child : new List<>(notebook)) {
    if (child.getDisplayName().equals("Remove Me")) {
        // Remove the Child Item from the Notebook
        notebook.removeChild(child);
    }
}
```

Here, we iterate through each child node of the notebook. We check if the display name matches the node we want to remove. If found, we remove it from the notebook.

## Step 3: Save the Modified Notebook

```java
dataDir = dataDir + "RemoveChildNodeFromOneNoteNotebook_out.onetoc2";
notebook.save(dataDir);
```

Finally, we specify the output directory and save the modified notebook after removing the desired child node.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've learned how to remove a child node from a OneNote Notebook using Aspose.Note for Java. With just a few simple steps, you can manipulate OneNote files programmatically, opening up a world of possibilities for document management and automation.
