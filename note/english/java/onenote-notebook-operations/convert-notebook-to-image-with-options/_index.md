ImageSaveOptions documentSaveOptions = notebookSaveOptions.getDocumentSaveOptions();

documentSaveOptions.setResolution(400);
```

## Step 3: Save the Notebook as Image

Now, we'll save the notebook as an image with the specified options.

```java
dataDir = dataDir + "ExportNotebooktoImagewithOptions_out.png";

// Save the Notebook
