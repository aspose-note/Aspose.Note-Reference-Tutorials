## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:

### Java Development Kit (JDK) Installed

## Import Packages

To get started with creating notebooks in OneNote using Aspose.Note for Java, you need to import the necessary packages into your Java project. Here's how you can do it:

```java

Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the path to the directory where you want to save the notebook file. This directory will be used to store the created notebook.

## Step 2: Create Notebook Object

Create a new `Notebook` object using the constructor provided by the Aspose.Note library. This object represents the notebook you'll be creating.

## Step 3: Save the Notebook
