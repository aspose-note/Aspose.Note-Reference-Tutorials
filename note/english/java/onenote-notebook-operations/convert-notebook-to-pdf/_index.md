## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of converting a notebook to PDF format using Aspose.Note for Java. Aspose.Note is a powerful library that allows you to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically, enabling you to automate tasks like conversion to PDF.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure that you have JDK installed on your system. You can download and install it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html).

2. Aspose.Note for Java Library: You need to have the Aspose.Note for Java library. You can download it from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).

## Import Packages

First, you need to import the necessary packages in your Java code to work with Aspose.Note. Here's how you can do it:

```java
import java.io.IOException;

import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.PdfSaveOptions;
```

## Step 1: Load the Notebook Document

```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document oneFile = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one");
```

In this step, we initialize a `Document` object and load the OneNote file ("Sample1.one") into it. Replace `"Your Document Directory"` with the actual directory where your OneNote file is located.

## Step 2: Initialize PDF Save Options

```java
PdfSaveOptions options = new PdfSaveOptions();
```

Here, we create a `PdfSaveOptions` object to specify any additional settings for the PDF conversion process. This step is optional, but it allows you to customize the conversion according to your requirements.

## Step 3: Save the Document as PDF

```java
oneFile.save(dataDir + "ConvertToPdf_out.pdf", options);
```

Finally, we call the `save` method on the `Document` object to convert the loaded notebook document to PDF format. You can specify the output file path where the converted PDF will be saved. 

## Step 4: Print Confirmation Message

```java
System.out.println("File saved: " + dataDir + "ConvertToPdf_out.pdf");
```

This step is optional but recommended for providing feedback to the user. It prints a confirmation message indicating the successful conversion and the location of the output PDF file.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've learned how to convert a notebook to PDF in OneNote using Aspose.Note for Java. By following these simple steps, you can automate the conversion process and integrate it into your Java applications seamlessly.
