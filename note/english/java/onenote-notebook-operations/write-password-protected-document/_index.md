```java
Document childDocument0 = (Document) notebook.get_Item(0);
childDocument0.save(dataDir + "Not Locked.one");

Document childDocument1 = (Document) notebook.get_Item(1);
OneSaveOptions documentSaveOptions1 = new OneSaveOptions();
documentSaveOptions1.setDocumentPassword("pass1");
childDocument1.save(dataDir + "Locked Pass1.one", documentSaveOptions1);

Document childDocument2 = (Document) notebook.get_Item(2);
OneSaveOptions documentSaveOptions2 = new OneSaveOptions();
documentSaveOptions2.setDocumentPassword("pass2");
childDocument2.save(dataDir + "Locked Pass2.one", documentSaveOptions2);
```
