# Convert Notebook to Image in OneNote - Aspose.Note

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to convert a notebook to an image in OneNote using the Aspose.Note for Java library. Converting notebooks to images can be useful for various purposes such as sharing notes, embedding them in documents, or incorporating them into presentations.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have Java installed on your system. You can download and install the latest version from the [website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk15-downloads.html).

2. Aspose.Note for Java Library: Download and include the Aspose.Note for Java library in your project. You can obtain the library from the [Aspose website](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).

## Import Packages

```java
import java.io.IOException;

import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.ImageSaveOptions;
import com.aspose.note.SaveFormat;
```

Now, let's break down the conversion process into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Load the Notebook Document

```java
// Specify the directory where your notebook file is located
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load the document into Aspose.Note
Document oneFile = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one");
```

In this step, we define the directory path where the notebook file is located. Then, we use the `Document` class from the Aspose.Note library to load the notebook document named "Sample1.one" into memory.

## Step 2: Initialize ImageSaveOptions

```java
// Initialize PdfSaveOptions object
ImageSaveOptions options = new ImageSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Png);
```

Here, we initialize an `ImageSaveOptions` object and specify the format in which we want to save the notebook document. In this case, we choose PNG format.

## Step 3: Save the Document as Image

```java
// Save the document as PNG
oneFile.save(dataDir + "ConvertToImage_out.png", options);
```

Now, we use the `save()` method to save the loaded notebook document as an image file. We provide the file path where we want to save the image and pass the initialized `ImageSaveOptions` object.

## Step 4: Print Confirmation

```java
System.out.println("File saved: " + dataDir + "ConvertToImage_out.png");
```

Finally, we print a confirmation message to the console indicating the successful conversion and the location where the image file has been saved.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to convert a notebook to an image in OneNote using the Aspose.Note for Java library. By following the steps outlined above, you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your Java applications.
