# Get Node Tags in OneNote - Aspose.Note

## Introduction
Welcome to the realm of Aspose.Note for Java! If you're looking to dive deep into managing and extracting information from OneNote documents, you're in the right place. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of getting node tags in OneNote using Aspose.Note for Java. By the end, you'll be equipped with the knowledge to harness the full potential of this powerful Java API.
## Prerequisites
Before embarking on this journey, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java Development Environment: Make sure you have a working Java development environment set up on your system.
- Aspose.Note Library: Download and install the Aspose.Note library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).
- OneNote Document: Have a OneNote document (e.g., "Sample1.one") ready for testing and exploration.
## Import Packages
Begin by importing the necessary packages into your Java project. These packages will provide the tools needed to interact with OneNote documents using Aspose.Note.
```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.List;
import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.ITag;
import com.aspose.note.NoteTag;
import com.aspose.note.RichText;
```
Now, let's break down the process of getting node tags in OneNote into easy-to-follow steps:
## Step 1: Load the OneNote Document
```java
// The path to the documents directory.
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
// Load the document into Aspose.Note
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one");
// Get all RichText nodes
List<RichText> nodes = doc.getChildNodes(RichText.class);
// Load the document into Aspose.Note
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Sample1.one");
```
Ensure you have the Aspose.Note document loaded and ready for further processing.
## Step 2: Retrieve RichText Nodes
```java
// Get all RichText nodes
List<RichText> nodes = doc.getChildNodes(RichText.class);
```
Extract all RichText nodes from the loaded OneNote document. These nodes contain the information we're interested in.
## Step 3: Iterate Through Each Node
```java
// Iterate through each node
for (RichText richText : nodes) {
    // Process each node here
}
```
Loop through each RichText node to access and analyze its content.
## Step 4: Retrieve Note Tags
```java
for (ITag tag : richText.getTags()) {
    if (tag.getClass() == NoteTag.class) {
        NoteTag noteTag = (NoteTag) tag;
        // Retrieve properties
        System.out.println("Completed Time: " + noteTag.getCompletedTime());
        System.out.println("Create Time: " + noteTag.getCreationTime());
        System.out.println("Font Color: " + noteTag.getFontColor());
        System.out.println("Status: " + noteTag.getStatus());
        System.out.println("Label: " + noteTag.getLabel());
        System.out.println("Icon: " + noteTag.getIcon());
        System.out.println("High Light: " + noteTag.getHighlight());
    }
}
```
For each RichText node, check for NoteTags and retrieve their properties. This step uncovers details like completion time, creation time, font color, status, label, icon, and highlight.
## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've successfully navigated the intricate landscape of extracting node tags from OneNote using Aspose.Note for Java. Armed with this knowledge, you can now seamlessly integrate this functionality into your Java applications.
