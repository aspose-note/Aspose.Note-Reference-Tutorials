# Add Tag in OneNote - Aspose.Note

## Introduction
Are you looking to enhance your document organization and collaboration in OneNote using Java? Aspose.Note for Java provides a powerful solution to add tags seamlessly, ensuring your notes are not just informative but also visually appealing. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the process step by step, so you can leverage the full potential of Aspose.Note for Java.
## Prerequisites
Before diving into the tutorial, make sure you have the following:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Aspose.Note for Java library downloaded. You can get it [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/java/).
- A basic understanding of Java programming.
## Import Packages
Ensure you import the necessary packages to kickstart your project:
```java
import java.awt.Color;
import java.io.IOException;
import com.aspose.note.Document;
import com.aspose.note.NoteTag;
import com.aspose.note.Outline;
import com.aspose.note.OutlineElement;
import com.aspose.note.Page;
import com.aspose.note.RichText;
import com.aspose.note.SaveFormat;
import com.aspose.note.TagIcon;
import com.aspose.note.ParagraphStyle;
```
Let's break down the above code into a step-by-step guide.
## Step 1: Set up Document and Page
Begin by creating a new Document object and initializing a Page object:
```java
String dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document doc = new Document();
Page page = new Page();
```
Here, we set the path to the documents directory, create a new Document, and initialize a Page.
## Step 2: Create an Outline
Next, create an Outline object to structure your content:
```java
Outline outline = new Outline();
```
Outlines provide a hierarchical structure to your document, making it easy to organize information.
## Step 3: Initialize OutlineElement and ParagraphStyle
Now, initialize an OutlineElement and set ParagraphStyle for text formatting:
```java
OutlineElement outlineElem = new OutlineElement();
ParagraphStyle textStyle = new ParagraphStyle()
                                .setFontColor(Color.black)
                                .setFontName("Arial")
                                .setFontSize(10);
```
OutlineElement represents an element within the outline, and ParagraphStyle defines text formatting properties.
## Step 4: Add RichText with NoteTag
Create a RichText object, append your OneNote text, and add a NoteTag:
```java
RichText text = new RichText().append("OneNote text.");
text.setParagraphStyle(textStyle);
NoteTag noteTag = NoteTag.createYellowStar();
text.getTags().add(noteTag);
```
RichText allows you to incorporate formatted text, and NoteTag adds visual cues to your content.
## Step 5: Build Outline Structure
Add the text node, outline element node, and outline node to construct the document's structure:
```java
outlineElem.appendChildLast(text);
outline.appendChildLast(outlineElem);
page.appendChildLast(outline);
doc.appendChildLast(page);
```
This step ensures your content is organized within the document.
## Step 6: Save the Document
Save the document in PDF format:
```java
doc.save(dataDir + "AddTag_out.pdf", SaveFormat.Pdf);
System.out.printf("File Saved: %s\n", dataDir + "AddTag_out.pdf");
```
Now, your OneNote document with added tags is saved as a PDF.
By following these steps, you can effortlessly enhance your OneNote documents using Aspose.Note for Java.
## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored how to use Aspose.Note for Java to add tags to OneNote documents. Leveraging the power of Java programming, you can enhance your note-taking experience and create visually appealing content.
