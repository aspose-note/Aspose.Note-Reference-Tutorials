## Step 2: Initialize TableCell and Set Text Content

Create a TableCell object and set its text content along with background color:

```csharp
TableCell cell11 = new TableCell(doc);
cell11.AppendChildLast(InsertTable.GetOutlineElementWithText(doc, "Small text"));
cell11.BackgroundColor = Color.Coral;
```

## Step 3: Initialize TableRow and Append Cell

Initialize a TableRow object and append the previously created cell:

```csharp
TableRow row = new TableRow(doc);
row.AppendChildLast(cell11);
```

## Step 4: Create Table with Specified Columns

Create a table with specified columns and make its borders visible:

```csharp
Table table = new Table(doc)
{
    IsBordersVisible = true,
    Columns = { new TableColumn() { Width = 200 } }
};
table.AppendChildLast(row);
```

## Step 5: Create Outline Element and Page

Create an outline element and page, and append the table to the page:

```csharp
OutlineElement oe = new OutlineElement(doc);
oe.AppendChildLast(table);

Outline o = new Outline(doc);
o.AppendChildLast(oe);

Page page = new Page(doc);
page.AppendChildLast(o);

doc.AppendChildLast(page);
```

## Step 6: Save Document

Save the document with the specified directory and file name:

```csharp
doc.Save(Path.Combine("Your Document Directory", "SettingCellBackGroundColor.pdf"));
```
