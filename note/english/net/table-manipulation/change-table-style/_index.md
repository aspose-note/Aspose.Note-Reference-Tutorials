# Change Table Style in Aspose.Note

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to change the table style in Aspose.Note using the .NET framework. Aspose.Note is a powerful API that enables developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically. By customizing the style of tables within OneNote documents, you can enhance their visual appeal and readability. We'll walk through the process of modifying table styles step by step, ensuring clarity and effectiveness.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:
1. Basic knowledge of C# programming language.
2. Visual Studio installed on your system.
3. Aspose.Note for .NET installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).
4. Access to a OneNote document that contains tables for styling.

## Importing Namespaces

To begin, make sure to import the necessary namespaces into your C# code. These namespaces provide access to the classes and methods required for manipulating tables in Aspose.Note.
```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Drawing;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
```

## Step 1: Load the Document

First, load the OneNote document into Aspose.Note to begin working with its content.
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document document = new Document(dataDir + "ChangeTableStyleIn.one");
```

## Step 2: Get Table Nodes

Retrieve a list of table nodes from the loaded document. This will allow us to iterate through each table and apply the desired style changes.
```csharp
IList<Table> nodes = document.GetChildNodes<Table>();
```

## Step 3: Customize Table Style

Iterate through each table in the document and customize its style according to your requirements. The example below demonstrates how to highlight the first row and alternate row colors.
```csharp
foreach (Table table in nodes)
{
    SetRowStyle(table.First(), Color.DarkGray, true, true);

    var flag = false;
    foreach (var row in table.Skip(1))
    {
        SetRowStyle(row, flag ? Color.LightGray : Color.Empty, false, false);
        flag = !flag;
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Save the Document

Once the table styles have been modified, save the updated document to preserve the changes.
```csharp
document.Save(Path.Combine(dataDir, "ChangeTableStyleOut.one"));
Console.WriteLine("\nTable's style is updated successfully.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
```
