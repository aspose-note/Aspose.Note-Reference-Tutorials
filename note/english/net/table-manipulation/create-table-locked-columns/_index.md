# Create Table with Locked Columns using Aspose.Note

## Introduction

Creating tables with locked columns is a common requirement in document processing applications. Aspose.Note for .NET provides powerful tools to accomplish this task efficiently. In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of creating a table with locked columns step by step using Aspose.Note for .NET.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of C# programming language.
- Visual Studio installed on your system.
- Aspose.Note for .NET installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).
- Familiarity with document manipulation concepts.

## Import Namespaces

First, you need to import the necessary namespaces to your project:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Note;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Drawing;
```

## Step 1: Initialize Document Object

Begin by creating an object of the Document class:

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
```

## Step 2: Initialize Page Object

Initialize the Page class object:

```csharp
Aspose.Note.Page page = new Aspose.Note.Page(doc);
```

## Step 3: Initialize TableRow Objects

Create TableRow objects for the table:

```csharp
TableRow row1 = new TableRow(doc);
TableRow row2 = new TableRow(doc);
```

## Step 4: Initialize TableCell Objects

Create TableCell objects and set text content for each cell:

```csharp
TableCell cell11 = new TableCell(doc);
cell11.AppendChildLast(InsertTable.GetOutlineElementWithText(doc, "Small text"));

TableCell cell21 = new TableCell(doc);
cell21.AppendChildLast(InsertTable.GetOutlineElementWithText(doc, "Long text with several words and spaces."));
```

## Step 5: Initialize Table Object

Initialize the Table class object and set properties like column width and locked width:

```csharp
Table table = new Table(doc)
{
    IsBordersVisible = true,
    Columns = { new TableColumn { Width = 70, LockedWidth = true } }
};
```

## Step 6: Add Rows to the Table

Add the initialized rows to the table:

```csharp
table.AppendChildLast(row1);
table.AppendChildLast(row2);
```

## Step 7: Add Table to Outline

Add the table node to the OutlineElement:

```csharp
Outline outline = new Outline(doc);
OutlineElement outlineElem = new OutlineElement(doc);
outlineElem.AppendChildLast(table);
outline.AppendChildLast(outlineElem);
```

## Step 8: Add Outline to Page

Add the outline node to the page:

```csharp
page.AppendChildLast(outline);
```

## Step 9: Save Document

Save the document:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
dataDir = dataDir + "CreateTableWithLockedColumns_out.one";
doc.Save(dataDir);
Console.WriteLine("\nTable with locked columns created successfully.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
```

After following these steps, you'll have successfully created a table with locked columns using Aspose.Note for .NET.
