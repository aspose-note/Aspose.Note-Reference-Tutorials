# Metered Licensing with Aspose.Note

## Introduction

In the realm of software development, managing licenses efficiently is crucial, especially when dealing with products like Aspose.Note for .NET. Metered licensing is a method that provides developers with greater flexibility and control over their software usage, allowing them to monitor and manage resource consumption effectively. In this tutorial, we will delve into the intricacies of metered licensing with Aspose.Note for .NET, breaking down each step to ensure a comprehensive understanding.

## Prerequisites

Before we embark on this journey of understanding metered licensing with Aspose.Note for .NET, let's ensure we have the necessary prerequisites in place:

1. Installation of Aspose.Note for .NET: Ensure that you have downloaded and installed Aspose.Note for .NET. You can obtain the latest version from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).

2. Access to Aspose.Note Documentation: Familiarize yourself with the Aspose.Note for .NET documentation, which provides detailed insights into its various features and functionalities. You can refer to the documentation [here](https://reference.aspose.com/note/net/).

## Import Namespaces

To begin utilizing metered licensing with Aspose.Note for .NET, import the necessary namespaces into your project. This step ensures that you have access to the required classes and methods.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
```

## Step 1: Set Metered Key

The first step involves setting the metered key, which authenticates your metered license. This key comprises a public key and a private key provided to you upon obtaining the metered license.

```csharp
// ExStart:MeteredLicense
Metered metered = new Metered();
metered.SetMeteredKey("MyPublicKey", "MyPrivateKey");
```

## Step 2: Perform Document Operation

Once the metered key is set, you can proceed with performing operations on your documents using Aspose.Note for .NET. For demonstration purposes, let's load a OneNote document and perform a basic operation.

```csharp
// Load OneNote document and get first child
Document document = new Document(Path.Combine(dataDir, "Aspose.one"));
```

## Step 3: Save Document

After performing the desired operations on the document, you can save it to your desired location. In this example, we will save the document as a PDF file.

```csharp
document.Save(Path.Combine(dataDir, "MeteredLicense.pdf"));
```

## Step 4: Monitor Consumption

One of the significant advantages of metered licensing is the ability to monitor resource consumption. You can retrieve information regarding credit and consumption quantity before and after performing operations.

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"Credit before operation: {Metered.GetConsumptionCredit():F2}");
Console.WriteLine($"Consumption quantity before operation: {Metered.GetConsumptionQuantity():F2}");
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, metered licensing with Aspose.Note for .NET offers developers a flexible and efficient way to manage their software usage. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can seamlessly integrate metered licensing into your projects, ensuring optimal utilization of resources.
