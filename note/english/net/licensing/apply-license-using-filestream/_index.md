# Apply Aspose.Note License using FileStream

## Introduction

Aspose.Note for .NET is a powerful API that allows developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically. Whether you need to create, read, modify, or convert OneNote documents, Aspose.Note for .NET provides comprehensive features to streamline your workflow. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to apply an Aspose.Note license using FileStream, ensuring your application is properly licensed for production use.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into this tutorial, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio on your system.
2. Aspose.Note for .NET: Download and install Aspose.Note for .NET from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).
3. License File: Obtain a valid Aspose.Note license file.
4. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language.

## Import Namespaces

To get started, let's import the necessary namespaces into our C# project:

```csharp
using Aspose.Note;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

## Step 1: Initialize Aspose.Note License Object

First, we need to create an instance of the `License` class from the Aspose.Note namespace:

```csharp
Aspose.Note.License license = new Aspose.Note.License();
```

## Step 2: Open License File Using FileStream

Next, we'll open the license file using a `FileStream`. Ensure that you have placed your license file in the project directory or provide the appropriate path to it:

```csharp
using (FileStream myStream = new FileStream("Aspose.Note.lic", FileMode.Open))
{
    // License file is loaded into memory stream
}
```

## Step 3: Apply License

Now, we'll apply the license by passing the `FileStream` object to the `SetLicense` method of the `License` object:

```csharp
license.SetLicense(myStream);
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've learned how to apply an Aspose.Note license using FileStream in a .NET application. Properly licensing your application ensures compliance and unlocks the full potential of Aspose.Note features.
