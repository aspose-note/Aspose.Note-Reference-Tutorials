## Introduction

Aspose.Note for .NET is a powerful API that allows developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically. Whether you're looking to create, modify, or convert OneNote documents, Aspose.Note provides a comprehensive set of features to meet your needs. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process of applying an Aspose.Note license from an embedded resource in your .NET application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:

### 1. Visual Studio Installed

Ensure that you have Visual Studio installed on your system. You can download it from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

### 2. Aspose.Note for .NET Installed

Make sure you have installed Aspose.Note for .NET. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).

### 3. Aspose.Note License File

## Import Namespaces

Aspose.Note.License license = new Aspose.Note.License();
```

Here, we create an instance of the `License` class provided by Aspose.Note.
