## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll delve into exploring page revisions in Aspose.Note documents using the .NET framework. Aspose.Note is a powerful library that enables developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically, offering various features to manipulate and extract data from these files.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites set up:

### 1. Download and Install Aspose.Note for .NET

Visit the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/) and download the Aspose.Note for .NET library. Follow the installation instructions provided to set up the library in your development environment.

### 2. Load Necessary Namespaces

Make sure to import the required namespaces in your .NET project to access the Aspose.Note functionalities seamlessly.

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Note;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```

Now, let's break down the process of exploring page revisions into step-by-step instructions:

## Step 1: Load the Document

Firstly, we need to load the Aspose.Note document, ensuring to enable loading of document history.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document document = new Document(dataDir + "Aspose.one", new LoadOptions { LoadHistory = true });
```

## Step 2: Retrieve the Page Revisions

Once the document is loaded, we can retrieve the revisions for a specific page. In this example, we'll get revisions for the first page.

```csharp
Page firstPage = document.FirstChild;
foreach (Page pageRevision in document.GetPageHistory(firstPage))
{
    /*Use pageRevision like a regular page.*/
    Console.WriteLine("LastModifiedTime: {0}", pageRevision.LastModifiedTime);
    Console.WriteLine("CreationTime: {0}", pageRevision.CreationTime);
    Console.WriteLine("Title: {0}", pageRevision.Title);
    Console.WriteLine("Level: {0}", pageRevision.Level);
    Console.WriteLine("Author: {0}", pageRevision.Author);
    Console.WriteLine();
}
```

## Step 3: Iterate Through Revisions

Within the loop, iterate through each revision of the page and access its properties such as last modified time, creation time, title, level, and author.

## Conclusion

Exploring page revisions in Aspose.Note documents using .NET is a straightforward process. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial, you can effectively retrieve and analyze the revision history of your OneNote files programmatically.
