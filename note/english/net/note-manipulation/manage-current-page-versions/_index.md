## Push and Manage Current Page Versions in Aspose.Note

Now, let's break down the process of pushing and managing current page versions into step-by-step guide format:

### Step 1: Load OneNote Document and Get First Child

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load OneNote document and get first child
Document document = new Document(dataDir + "Aspose.one");
Page page = document.FirstChild;
```

In this step, we specify the path to the directory containing our OneNote document. We then load the document and retrieve the first child page.

### Step 2: Retrieve Page History and Add Current Version

```csharp
var pageHistory = document.GetPageHistory(page);

pageHistory.Add(page.Clone());
```

Here, we retrieve the page history using the `GetPageHistory` method. We then clone the current page and add it to the page history using the `Add` method.

### Step 3: Save the Document with Updated Page Version

```csharp
document.Save(dataDir + "PushCurrentPageVersion_out.one");
```

Finally, we save the document with the updated page version to the specified directory.
