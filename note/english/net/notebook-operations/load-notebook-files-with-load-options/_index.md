# Load Notebook Files with Load Options in Aspose Note .NET

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into the intricacies of loading notebook files with load options using Aspose.Note for .NET. Aspose.Note is a powerful API that enables developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically, offering seamless integration and efficient handling of notebook data.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Installation of Aspose.Note for .NET: Make sure you have installed the Aspose.Note for .NET library. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).

2. Basic Understanding of .NET Framework: Familiarity with the .NET framework and C# programming language will be beneficial.

3. Development Environment: Set up your preferred development environment, such as Visual Studio.

## Import Namespaces

Firstly, let's import the necessary namespaces to kickstart our coding journey:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

## Step 1: Load the Notebook File

To load a notebook file with load options, follow these steps:

### Step 1.1: Specify the Input File Path

```csharp
string inputFile = "NotebookFile.onetoc2";
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
```

Replace `"NotebookFile.onetoc2"` with the name of your notebook file and `"Your Document Directory"` with the directory path where your file resides.

### Step 1.2: Instantiate Notebook Object

```csharp
Notebook notebook = new Notebook(dataDir + inputFile);
```

Here, we create an instance of the `Notebook` class, passing the path of the notebook file as a parameter.

## Step 2: Iterate Through Notebook Documents

Now, let's iterate through the documents within the notebook using lazy loading:

### Step 2.1: Iterate Using `foreach` Loop

```csharp
foreach (var notebookChildNode in notebook.OfType<Document>()) 
{
    // Actual loading of the child document happens only here.
    // Do something with child document
}
```

Here, we use a `foreach` loop to iterate through each document within the notebook. The `OfType<Document>()` method filters out only document objects from the notebook.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've learned how to load notebook files with load options using Aspose.Note for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide, you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your .NET applications, enabling efficient handling of notebook data.
