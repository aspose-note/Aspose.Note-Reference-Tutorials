# Load Notebooks from Stream in Aspose Note .NET

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will explore how to load notebooks from a stream using Aspose.Note for .NET. Aspose.Note is a powerful library that enables developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically. Loading notebooks from a stream is a common task when dealing with file input/output operations in .NET applications.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this tutorial, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of C# programming language.
- Visual Studio installed on your system.
- Aspose.Note for .NET library installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).

## Import Namespaces

To get started, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your C# code:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Note;
using Aspose.Note.Saving;
using System;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Globalization;
```

## Step 1: Prepare Your Environment

Ensure that you have set up your development environment with Visual Studio and have installed Aspose.Note for .NET library.

## Step 2: Create FileStream for Notebook

Firstly, you need to create a `FileStream` object to open the notebook file from a specific location on your system.

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

FileStream stream = new FileStream(dataDir + "Notizbuch Ã¶ffnen.onetoc2", FileMode.Open);
```

## Step 3: Initialize Notebook Object

Initialize a `Notebook` object by passing the created `FileStream` object.

```csharp
var notebook = new Notebook(stream);
```

## Step 4: Load Child Documents

Now, load child documents into the notebook. You can do this by calling the `LoadChildDocument` method and passing a `FileStream` object or a file path.

```csharp
using (FileStream childStream = new FileStream(dataDir + "Aspose.one", FileMode.Open))
{
    notebook.LoadChildDocument(childStream);
}

notebook.LoadChildDocument(dataDir + "Sample1.one");
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've learned how to load notebooks from a stream in Aspose.Note for .NET. By following the step-by-step guide, you can seamlessly integrate this functionality into your .NET applications.
