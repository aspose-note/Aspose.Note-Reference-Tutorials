## Import Namespaces

Before diving into the implementation, make sure to import the necessary namespaces:

## Step 1: Load the Notebook

First, we need to load the notebook where we want to remove the child node from.

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load a OneNote Notebook
var notebook = new Notebook(dataDir + "test.onetoc2");
```

## Step 2: Traverse Child Nodes

Next, we'll traverse through the child nodes of the notebook to find the specific child item we want to remove.

```csharp
foreach (var child in new List<INotebookChildNode>(notebook))
{
    if (child.DisplayName == "Remove Me")
    {
        // Remove the Child Item from the Notebook
        notebook.RemoveChild(child);
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Save the Notebook

Once the child node is removed, we'll save the modified notebook.

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "RemoveChildNode_out.onetoc2";

// Save the Notebook
notebook.Save(dataDir);
```
