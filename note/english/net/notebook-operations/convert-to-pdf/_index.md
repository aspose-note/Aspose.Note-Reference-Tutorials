## Import Namespaces

To start with the conversion process, you need to import the necessary namespaces in your .NET project. Follow these steps:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Note;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```

Let's dive into the conversion process. We'll break down each step into manageable chunks for easy understanding.

## Step 1: Load the Notebook

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load a OneNote Notebook
var notebook = new Notebook(dataDir + "Notizbuch Ã¶ffnen.onetoc2");
```

In this step, we specify the directory where our notebook file is located and load it into our application using the `Notebook` class provided by Aspose.Note.

## Step 2: Specify Output PDF Path

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "ConvertToPDF_out.pdf";
```

Here, we define the path where our converted PDF file will be saved. You can customize this path according to your requirements.

## Step 3: Save the Notebook as PDF

```csharp
// Save the Notebook
notebook.Save(dataDir);
```

Using the `Save` method of the `Notebook` class, we save the loaded notebook as a PDF file at the specified output path.
