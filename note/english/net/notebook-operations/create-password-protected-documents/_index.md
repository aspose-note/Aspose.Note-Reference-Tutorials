## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll delve into the process of creating password-protected documents using Aspose.Note for .NET. Document security is paramount, especially when dealing with sensitive information. With Aspose.Note, you can encrypt your documents to safeguard them from unauthorized access. We'll guide you through the steps necessary to implement this security measure effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Aspose.Note for .NET: Make sure you have installed Aspose.Note for .NET. If not, you can download it from the [website](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).
2. Development Environment: Have a development environment set up for .NET programming, including Visual Studio or any other preferred IDE.
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarize yourself with C# programming language basics as we'll be using it in our examples.

## Import Namespaces

Before we dive into the implementation, let's import the necessary namespaces to facilitate our coding process:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Note;
using Aspose.Note.Saving;
using System;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Globalization;
```

Now, let's break down the process of creating password-protected documents into simple steps:

## Step 1: Initialize a New Document Object

Firstly, initialize a new `Document` object using Aspose.Note:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document document = new Document();
```

## Step 2: Save Document with Encryption

Next, specify the password for the document encryption and save the document:

```csharp
document.Save(dataDir + "CreatingPasswordProtectedDoc_out.one", new OneSaveOptions() { DocumentPassword = "pass" });
```
