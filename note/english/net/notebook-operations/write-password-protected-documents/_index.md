# Write Password-Protected Documents in Aspose Note .NET

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will delve into the process of creating password-protected documents using Aspose.Note for .NET. Password protection adds an extra layer of security to your documents, ensuring that only authorized individuals can access their contents. We'll guide you through each step, from importing namespaces to writing the code for password protection.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:
- Basic knowledge of C# programming language.
- Visual Studio installed on your system.
- Aspose.Note for .NET installed. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).

## Import Namespaces

First, let's import the necessary namespaces to access the functionality of Aspose.Note for .NET.

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Note;
using Aspose.Note.Saving;
using System;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Globalization;
```

## Step 1: Load the Notebook
```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load the notebook
var notebook = new Notebook(dataDir + "test.onetoc2", new NotebookLoadOptions() { DeferredLoading = false });
```

## Step 2: Save the Notebook
```csharp
// Save the notebook
notebook.Save(dataDir + "notebook_out.onetoc2", new NotebookOneSaveOptions() { DeferredSaving = true});
```

## Step 3: Check if Notebook Has Child Documents
```csharp
if (notebook.Any())
```

## Step 4: Access Child Documents and Save with Password Protection
```csharp
// Access child documents
var childDocument0 = notebook[0] as Document;
var childDocument1 = notebook[1] as Document;
var childDocument2 = notebook[2] as Document;

// Save child documents with password protection
childDocument0.Save(dataDir + "Not Locked_out.one");

childDocument1.Save(dataDir + "Locked Pass1_out.one", new OneSaveOptions() { DocumentPassword = "pass" });

childDocument2.Save(dataDir + "Locked Pass2_out.one", new OneSaveOptions() { DocumentPassword = "pass2" });
```
