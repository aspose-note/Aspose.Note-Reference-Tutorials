# Convert Notebooks to PDF (Flattened) in Aspose Note .NET

## Introduction

Are you looking to convert your OneNote notebooks into flattened PDFs using Aspose Note .NET? You're in the right place! In this tutorial, we'll walk through the process step by step.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following:

1. Aspose.Note for .NET: Ensure you have downloaded and installed Aspose.Note for .NET. If not, you can get it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).
2. Visual Studio: You'll need Visual Studio installed on your system for coding and compilation.
3. OneNote Notebook: Have a OneNote Notebook ready that you want to convert to a PDF.

## Import Namespaces

Let's start by importing the necessary namespaces in your C# code:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Note;
using Aspose.Note.Saving;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```

## Step 1: Load the OneNote Notebook

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load a OneNote Notebook
var notebook = new Notebook(dataDir + "Notizbuch ï¿½ffnen.onetoc2");
```

In this step, we load the OneNote Notebook using the `Notebook` class provided by Aspose.Note.

## Step 2: Convert to PDF with Flattening

```csharp
// Save the Notebook as PDF with flattening
dataDir = dataDir + "ConvertToPDFAsFlattened_out.pdf";
notebook.Save(
    dataDir,
    new NotebookPdfSaveOptions
    {
        Flatten = true
    }); 
```

Here, we save the loaded notebook as a PDF with the `Flatten` property set to `true`. This property flattens all the content, including annotations and images, into the PDF.

## Step 3: Print Success Message

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nNoteBook document converted to PDF as flattened successfully.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
```

Finally, we print a success message along with the path where the PDF is saved.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully converted your OneNote Notebook to a flattened PDF using Aspose.Note for .NET. This process ensures that all your content is preserved accurately in the PDF format, making it easier to share and distribute.
