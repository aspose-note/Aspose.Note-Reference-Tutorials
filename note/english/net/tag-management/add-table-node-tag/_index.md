# Add Table Node with Tag in Aspose.Note

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll guide you through the process of adding a table node with a tag using Aspose.Note for .NET. Follow the steps below to achieve this.

## Import Namespaces

Before getting started, make sure to import the necessary namespaces to work with Aspose.Note:

```csharp
using System.Drawing;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Note;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using Aspose.Note.Examples.CSharp.Tables;
```

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites set up before proceeding:

1. Installation: Download and install the Aspose.Note for .NET library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).
2. License: Acquire a license or use a [temporary license](https://purchase.aspose.com/temporary-license/) to use the library.
3. Development Environment: Have a compatible development environment set up, such as Visual Studio.

## Step 1: Initialize Document and Page Objects

Start by creating an instance of the `Document` class and initializing a `Page` object:

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
Aspose.Note.Page page = new Aspose.Note.Page(doc);
```

## Step 2: Create Table, Row, and Cell Objects

Initialize the `Table`, `TableRow`, and `TableCell` objects:

```csharp
TableRow row = new TableRow(doc);
TableCell cell = new TableCell(doc);
```

## Step 3: Insert Content into Cell

Add content to the cell by using the `AppendChildLast` method:

```csharp
cell.AppendChildLast(InsertTable.GetOutlineElementWithText(doc, "Single cell."));
```

## Step 4: Initialize Table Node

Initialize the `Table` object with specified properties:

```csharp
Table table = new Table(doc)
{
    IsBordersVisible = true,
    Columns = { new TableColumn { Width = 70 } }
};
```

## Step 5: Add Row to Table

Add the row node to the table:

```csharp
table.AppendChildLast(row);
```

## Step 6: Add Tag to Table Node

Include a tag for the table node:

```csharp
table.Tags.Add(NoteTag.CreateQuestionMark());
```

## Step 7: Add Table Node to Outline Element

Create an `Outline` and `OutlineElement` to add the table node:

```csharp
Outline outline = new Outline(doc);
OutlineElement outlineElem = new OutlineElement(doc);
outlineElem.AppendChildLast(table);
outline.AppendChildLast(outlineElem);
page.AppendChildLast(outline);
doc.AppendChildLast(page);
```

## Step 8: Save Document

Save the OneNote document:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
dataDir = dataDir + "AddTableNodeWithTag_out.one";
doc.Save(dataDir);
Console.WriteLine("\nTable node with tag added successfully.\nFile saved at " + dataDir);
```

After following these steps, you should have successfully added a table node with a tag using Aspose.Note for .NET.
