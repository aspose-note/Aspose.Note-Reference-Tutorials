# Add Image Node with Tag in Aspose.Note

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to add an image node with a tag using Aspose.Note for .NET. This feature allows you to enhance your OneNote documents by adding images with custom tags.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

1. Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio IDE on your system.
2. Aspose.Note for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.Note for .NET library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge: Familiarize yourself with C# programming language and .NET framework.

## Import Namespaces

First, make sure to include the necessary namespaces in your C# code:

```csharp
using System.Drawing;
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Note;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
```

## Step 1: Initialize Document and Page Objects

Begin by creating an instance of the `Document` class and a `Page` object:

```csharp
Document doc = new Document();
Aspose.Note.Page page = new Aspose.Note.Page(doc);
```

## Step 2: Initialize Outline and OutlineElement Objects

Next, initialize `Outline` and `OutlineElement` objects:

```csharp
Outline outline = new Outline(doc);
OutlineElement outlineElem = new OutlineElement(doc);
```

## Step 3: Load and Insert Image

Load the desired image and insert it into the document node:

```csharp
Aspose.Note.Image image = new Aspose.Note.Image(doc, "path_to_your_image.jpg");
outlineElem.AppendChildLast(image);
```

## Step 4: Add Tag to the Image

Add a custom tag to the image:

```csharp
image.Tags.Add(NoteTag.CreateYellowStar());
```

## Step 5: Append Outline Element and Page Nodes

Append the outline element and outline nodes to the page:

```csharp
outline.AppendChildLast(outlineElem);
page.AppendChildLast(outline);
```

## Step 6: Save the Document

Save the modified OneNote document:

```csharp
doc.AppendChildLast(page);
string outputFilePath = "output_path/AddImageNodeWithTag_out.one";
doc.Save(outputFilePath);
```
