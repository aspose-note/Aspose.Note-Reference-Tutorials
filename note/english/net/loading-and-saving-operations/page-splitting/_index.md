# Page Splitting in Aspose.Note

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to split pages effectively using Aspose.Note for .NET. Page splitting is a crucial functionality, especially when dealing with lengthy OneNote pages that need to be converted into PDF format. Aspose.Note offers various algorithms to control the splitting logic, ensuring the resulting PDFs are well-organized and readable.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Visual Studio: Install Visual Studio on your system.
2. Aspose.Note for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.Note for .NET library from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).
3. Basic Knowledge of C#: Familiarity with C# programming language will be helpful.

## Import Namespaces

First, let's import the necessary namespaces to our C# project:

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Note;
using System;
using Aspose.Note.Saving;
```

## Step 1: Load the Document

Load the OneNote document into Aspose.Note using the following code snippet:

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load the document into Aspose.Note.
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Aspose.one");
```

## Step 2: Configure PDF Save Options

Now, configure the PDF save options including the page splitting algorithm. Aspose.Note provides different algorithms for page splitting. Here, we'll use the `KeepPartAndCloneSolidObjectToNextPageAlgorithm` algorithm.

```csharp
var pdfSaveOptions = new PdfSaveOptions();
pdfSaveOptions.PageSplittingAlgorithm = new KeepPartAndCloneSolidObjectToNextPageAlgorithm(100);
// or
pdfSaveOptions.PageSplittingAlgorithm = new KeepPartAndCloneSolidObjectToNextPageAlgorithm(400);
```

## Step 3: Save the Document

Save the modified document with the specified page splitting algorithm:

```csharp
string outputFilePath = dataDir + "PageSplittUsingKeepPartAndCloneSolidObjectToNextPageAlgorithm_out.pdf";
doc.Save(outputFilePath, pdfSaveOptions);
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to split pages effectively in Aspose.Note for .NET using different algorithms. By following these steps, you can ensure that your lengthy OneNote pages are neatly organized when converted into PDF format.
