# Specify Save Options in Aspose.Note

## Introduction

In the realm of .NET development, Aspose.Note stands out as a powerful tool for working with OneNote documents. It offers a comprehensive set of features to manipulate and manage these files efficiently. One crucial aspect of working with Aspose.Note is specifying save options, which allows developers to customize the output format and quality according to their requirements.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into specifying save options in Aspose.Note for .NET, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Familiarity with C#: A basic understanding of C# programming language is necessary to grasp the concepts discussed in this tutorial.
   
2. Installation of Aspose.Note for .NET: Make sure you have Aspose.Note for .NET installed in your development environment. If not, you can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).

## Import Namespaces

Before you begin working with Aspose.Note in your .NET application, you need to import the required namespaces. These namespaces provide access to the classes and methods needed to manipulate OneNote documents efficiently.

```csharp
using System.IO;
using Aspose.Note;
using Aspose.Note.Saving;
using System;
```

Let's break down the example provided into multiple steps to understand the process of specifying save options in Aspose.Note for .NET.

## Step 1: Load the OneNote Document

```csharp
// The path to the documents directory.
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

// Load the document into Aspose.Note.
Document doc = new Document(dataDir + "Aspose.one");
```

In this step, we specify the path to the directory containing the OneNote document and load the document using the `Document` class provided by Aspose.Note.

## Step 2: Initialize Save Options

```csharp
// Initialize PdfSaveOptions object
PdfSaveOptions opts = new PdfSaveOptions
{
    // Use Jpeg compression
    ImageCompression = Saving.Pdf.PdfImageCompression.Jpeg,
    
    // Quality for JPEG compression
    JpegQuality = 90
};
```

Here, we initialize the `PdfSaveOptions` object, which allows us to specify various settings for saving the document as a PDF file. In this example, we enable JPEG compression and set the quality to 90.

## Step 3: Save the Document with Options

```csharp
dataDir = dataDir + "Document.SaveWithOptions_out.pdf";
doc.Save(dataDir, opts);
```

Finally, we save the OneNote document with the specified save options using the `Save` method of the `Document` class. The output PDF file will be saved with the specified options.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've explored how to specify save options in Aspose.Note for .NET to customize the output format and quality when saving OneNote documents. By following these steps, developers can effectively manipulate and manage their OneNote files according to their specific requirements.
