## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to save documents as images in TIFF format using Aspose.Note for .NET. Aspose.Note is a powerful API that allows developers to work with Microsoft OneNote files programmatically. Saving OneNote documents as TIFF images can be useful for various applications such as archiving, sharing, or printing.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, ensure you have the following:

1. Aspose.Note for .NET: Make sure you have installed Aspose.Note for .NET. You can download it from [here](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).

2. Development Environment: Set up a development environment with Visual Studio or any other .NET IDE.

3. OneNote Document: Prepare a sample OneNote document that you want to convert to TIFF format.

## Import Namespaces

First, you need to import the necessary namespaces to your project:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

using Aspose.Note.Saving;

```

## Step 1: Save to TIFF using JPEG Compression

JPEG compression is a widely used method for reducing the size of images while preserving quality. Here's how you can save a OneNote document as a TIFF image with JPEG compression:

```csharp
public static void SaveToTiffUsingJpegCompression()
{
    // Load the document into Aspose.Note.
    Document oneFile = new Document("Path_to_your_OneNote_document");

    // Set the destination path for the TIFF image.
    var dst = "Destination_path_for_TIFF_image";

    // Save the document as a TIFF image with JPEG compression.
    oneFile.Save(dst, new ImageSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Tiff)
    {
        TiffCompression = TiffCompression.Jpeg,
        Quality = 93 // Adjust quality as needed
    });

    Console.WriteLine("\nOneNote document converted successfully to image in TIFF format using JPEG compression.\nFile saved at " + dst);
}
```

## Step 2: Save to TIFF using PackBits Compression

PackBits compression is a simple and efficient compression algorithm commonly used in TIFF images. Here's how you can save a OneNote document as a TIFF image with PackBits compression:

```csharp
public static void SaveToTiffUsingPackBitsCompression()
{
    // Load the document into Aspose.Note.
    Document oneFile = new Document("Path_to_your_OneNote_document");

    // Set the destination path for the TIFF image.
    var dst = "Destination_path_for_TIFF_image";

    // Save the document as a TIFF image with PackBits compression.
    oneFile.Save(dst, new ImageSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Tiff)
    {
        TiffCompression = TiffCompression.PackBits
    });

    Console.WriteLine("\nOneNote document converted successfully to image in TIFF format using PackBits compression.\nFile saved at " + dst);
}
```

## Step 3: Save to TIFF using CCITT Group 3 Compression

CCITT Group 3 compression, also known as fax compression, is suitable for black and white images. Here's how you can save a OneNote document as a TIFF image with CCITT Group 3 compression:

```csharp
public static void SaveToTiffUsingCcitt3Compression()
{
    // Load the document into Aspose.Note.
    Document oneFile = new Document("Path_to_your_OneNote_document");

    // Set the destination path for the TIFF image.
    var dst = "Destination_path_for_TIFF_image";

    // Save the document as a TIFF image with CCITT Group 3 compression.
    oneFile.Save(dst, new ImageSaveOptions(SaveFormat.Tiff)
    {
        ColorMode = ColorMode.BlackAndWhite,
        TiffCompression = TiffCompression.Ccitt3
    });

    Console.WriteLine("\nOneNote document converted successfully to image in TIFF format using CCITT Group 3 fax compression.\nFile saved at " + dst);
}
```

By following these steps, you can easily save your OneNote documents as TIFF images with different compression options using Aspose.Note for .NET.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've learned how to save OneNote documents as TIFF images using various compression methods with Aspose.Note for .NET. Whether you need JPEG, PackBits, or CCITT Group 3 compression, Aspose.Note provides the flexibility to handle different requirements efficiently.
