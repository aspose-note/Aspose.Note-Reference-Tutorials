# User-Saving Callbacks in Aspose.Note

## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to implement user-saving callbacks in Aspose.Note for .NET. These callbacks allow you to customize the saving process by providing hooks to intervene at different stages, such as saving fonts, CSS stylesheets, and images. By utilizing these callbacks, you can tailor the saving behavior to suit your specific requirements, enhancing the flexibility and control over the output.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the implementation of user-saving callbacks in Aspose.Note, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. Aspose.Note for .NET SDK: Download and install the Aspose.Note for .NET SDK from the [download page](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).
   
2. Development Environment: Have a suitable development environment set up, such as Visual Studio or any other .NET development environment.

## Import Namespaces

To begin, make sure to import the necessary namespaces into your project to access the required classes and methods from the Aspose.Note library:

```csharp
using Aspose.Note.Saving.Html;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

Now, let's break down the implementation of user-saving callbacks into multiple steps:

## Step 1: Define Callback Properties

```csharp
public string RootFolder { get; set; }
public bool KeepCssStreamOpened { get; set; }
public string CssFolder { get; set; }
public Stream CssStream { get; private set; }
public string FontsFolder { get; set; }
public string ImagesFolder { get; set; }
```

Here, we define various properties to specify the root folder, CSS folder, fonts folder, images folder, and other relevant settings.

## Step 2: Implement Font Saving Callback

```csharp
public void FontSaving(FontSavingArgs args)
{
    string uri;
    Stream stream;
    this.CreateResourceInFolder(this.FontsFolder, args.FileName, out uri, out stream);
    args.Stream = stream;
    args.Uri = Path.Combine("..", uri).Replace("\\", "\\\\");
}
```

In this step, we implement the `FontSaving` callback method to handle the saving of fonts. It creates a resource in the specified fonts folder and assigns the stream and URI accordingly.

## Step 3: Implement CSS Saving Callback

```csharp
public void CssSaving(CssSavingArgs args)
{
    string uri;
    Stream stream;
    this.CreateResourceInFolder(this.CssFolder, args.FileName, out uri, out stream);
    args.Stream = this.CssStream = stream;
    args.KeepStreamOpen = this.KeepCssStreamOpened;
    args.Uri = uri;
}
```

Here, we define the `CssSaving` callback method to manage the saving of CSS stylesheets. It creates a resource in the specified CSS folder and sets the stream, URI, and other properties accordingly.

## Step 4: Implement Image Saving Callback

```csharp
public void ImageSaving(ImageSavingArgs args)
{
    string uri;
    Stream stream;
    this.CreateResourceInFolder(this.ImagesFolder, args.FileName, out uri, out stream);
    args.Stream = stream;
    args.Uri = uri;
}
```

Lastly, we implement the `ImageSaving` callback method to handle the saving of images. Similar to previous steps, it creates a resource in the specified images folder and assigns the stream and URI.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've learned how to implement user-saving callbacks in Aspose.Note for .NET. By following the provided steps, you can customize the saving process for fonts, CSS stylesheets, and images, allowing for greater flexibility and control over the output.

## FAQs

### Q1: Can I use these callbacks to customize other aspects of the saving process?

A1: Yes, you can extend these callbacks or implement additional ones to customize various aspects of the saving process according to your needs.

### Q2: Is Aspose.Note for .NET compatible with other .NET frameworks?

A2: Yes, Aspose.Note for .NET is compatible with various .NET frameworks, including .NET Core and .NET Standard.

### Q3: How can I handle errors or exceptions during the saving process?

A3: You can incorporate error handling mechanisms within each callback method to gracefully handle any errors or exceptions that may occur.

### Q4: Are there any performance considerations when using these callbacks?

A4: While these callbacks offer flexibility, ensure they are implemented efficiently to avoid any performance overhead, especially when dealing with large documents or resources.

### Q5: Can I dynamically change the saving behavior based on user input or other conditions?

A5: Yes, you can incorporate conditional logic within the callback methods to adjust the saving behavior dynamically based on various factors.
