# Highlight All Recent Changes in Aspose.Note Text

## Introduction
Are you looking to add dynamic and visually appealing features to your Note documents using .NET? Aspose.Note for .NET is a powerful solution that allows you to manipulate and enhance your Note files seamlessly. In this tutorial, we'll dive into one specific aspect: highlighting all recent changes in Aspose.Note text.
## Prerequisites
Before we embark on this journey, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Aspose.Note for .NET: Ensure that you have the Aspose.Note library installed. You can download it from the [Aspose.Note for .NET documentation](https://reference.aspose.com/note/net/).
- Development Environment: Set up a .NET development environment, including an IDE like Visual Studio.
- Sample Document: Prepare a Note document (in this case, "Aspose.one") that contains the text you want to highlight.
## Import Namespaces
To get started, import the necessary namespaces in your .NET project:
```csharp
    using System;
    using System.Drawing;
    using System.IO;
    using System.Linq;
```
## Step 1: Load the Document
Begin by loading the Note document into Aspose.Note:
```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";
Document document = new Document(dataDir + "Aspose.one");
```
## Step 2: Identify Recent Changes
Next, identify RichText nodes modified within the last week:
```csharp
var richTextNodes = document.GetChildNodes<RichText>().Where(e => e.LastModifiedTime >= DateTime.Today.Subtract(TimeSpan.FromDays(7)));
```
## Step 3: Set Highlight Colors
Now, set the highlight color for the identified nodes and text runs:
```csharp
foreach (var node in richTextNodes)
{
    // Set highlight color for paragraph
    node.ParagraphStyle.Highlight = Color.DarkGreen;
    // Set highlight color for each text run
    foreach (var run in node.TextRuns)
    {
        run.Style.Highlight = Color.DarkSeaGreen;
    }
}
```
## Step 4: Save the Modified Document
Save the document with highlighted recent changes:
```csharp
document.Save(Path.Combine(dataDir, "HighlightAllRecentChanges.pdf"));
```
## Step 5: Display Success Message
Finally, display a success message to inform the user:
```csharp
Console.WriteLine("\nText's recent changes are highlighted successfully.");
```
