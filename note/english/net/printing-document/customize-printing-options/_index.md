# Customize Printing with Aspose.Note Print Options

## Introduction

Printing documents with Aspose.Note for .NET can be tailored to meet specific requirements using print options. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to customize printing using various options provided by Aspose.Note. Whether you need to adjust printer settings, set resolutions, or define page splitting algorithms, Aspose.Note offers flexibility to achieve desired printing outcomes.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the customization process, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Aspose.Note for .NET: Download and install the Aspose.Note for .NET library from the [download link](https://releases.aspose.com/note/net/).
2. Document to Print: Have a document ready in the directory where your code can access it.

## Import Namespaces

Make sure to import the necessary namespaces to access the required classes and methods:

```csharp
using Aspose.Note.Saving;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Drawing.Printing;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
```

## Step 1: Load Document

Load the document you intend to print using Aspose.Note:

```csharp
string dataDir = "Your Document Directory";

var document = new Aspose.Note.Document(dataDir + "Aspose.one");

```

## Step 2: Define Printer Settings

Specify printer settings such as page range, orientation, and margins:

```csharp
var printerSettings = new PrinterSettings()
{
    FromPage = 0,
    ToPage = 10
};
printerSettings.DefaultPageSettings.Landscape = true;
printerSettings.DefaultPageSettings.Margins = new System.Drawing.Printing.Margins(50, 50, 150, 50);
```

## Step 3: Set Print Options

Configure print options including printer settings, resolution, page splitting algorithm, and document name:

```csharp
document.Print(new PrintOptions()
{
    PrinterSettings = printerSettings,
    Resolution = 1200,
    PageSplittingAlgorithm = new KeepSolidObjectsAlgorithm(),
    DocumentName = "Test.one"
});
```
